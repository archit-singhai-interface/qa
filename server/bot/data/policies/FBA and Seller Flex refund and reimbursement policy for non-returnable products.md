Until 15 November, 2021, we will evaluate seller-controllable return rates (SCRR) for non-returnable products at a category level. Starting 16 November, 2021, the SCRR for non-returnable products will be evaluated at both the category level and the product (ASIN) level. We will provide you with a category and ASIN target SCRR percentage, and if your category-level or your ASIN-level SCRR percentage is higher than the respective target percentage, you may be charged for the refund issued to buyers.

For the first evaluation of the revised SCRR policy going into effect 16 November, 2021, the assessment period will be for 30 days. We will review orders that are shipped between 16 November, 2021 and 15 December, 2021, and any SCRR refunds for these orders will be paid out between 16 November, 2021 and 31 December, 2021.

#### Q1. What is the concession policy for non-returnable products?

Upon receiving a buyer complaint regarding a defect on a non-returnable item sold on Amazon.in, such as a damaged or defective item, or an item that is different from what was ordered, Amazon may proceed to refund the buyer to ensure customer satisfaction with the store as per Amazon’s seller refund policies. We reserve the right to charge you the refund amount if the defect is controllable by you, and will inform you when you are charged for this type of refund. You will not be reimbursed for such refunds, and any already-paid reimbursement may be clawed back.

#### Q2. What are seller-controllable concessions or returns?

Seller-controllable returns refer to products that were returned by the buyer or refunds that were issued to buyers for product-related issues that you can control.

For example, as a seller-controllable return could occur in any of these scenarios: if a buyer receives a defective or damaged product, if the size and fit of the product don’t meet the buyer’s expectations, if the quality of the product doesn’t meet the buyer’s expectations, or if inaccurate or incomplete information is provided on the product detail page.

To prevent seller-controllable returns and enable better performance metrics, make sure to follow customer-friendly selling practices, such as high-quality packaging, dunnage, and other remedial actions.

#### Q3. How is the seller-controllable return rate calculated for non-returnable products?

The SCRR of non-returnable products and non-returnable category of products can be calculated using the following formulas:

SCCR of a non-returnable product = Number of SCRR-refunded orders of the product / Total number of shipped orders of the product

SCRR of a category of non-returnable products = Number of SCRR-refunded orders in a category / Total number of shipped orders in the category

**Note:** For calculating the SCRR of a category of non-returnable products, we will only consider the orders and refunds of non-returnable products in the category.

#### Q4. What duration will be considered for evaluating the seller-controllable return rate?

We will evaluate the SCRR of a category or ASIN of non-returnable products over the course of a month. We will review orders shipped between the 16th of a month and the 15th of the next month, as well as SCRR refunds paid out against these orders up to the end of the second month.

For example, we will review orders that ship between 16 December, 2021 and 15 January, 2022, and SCRR refunds against these orders will be paid out between 16 December, 2021 and 31 January, 2022.

For the first evaluation of the revised SCRR policy going into effect 16 November, 2021, the assessment period will be for 30 days. We will review orders that are shipped between 16 November, 2021 and 15 December, 2021, and SCRR refunds for these orders paid out between 16 November, 2021 and 31 December, 2021.

We might also re-evaluate the SCRR of a category or an ASIN over an assessment period of 7 days or 15 days, depending on business requirements. We will be communicating these changes prior to the evaluation.

#### Q5. How can I track the SCRR rate on my account?

You can track the SCRR of each product for the last 30 days on the [Voice of Customer (VOC) dashboard](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/voice-of-the-customer).

For each assessment period, the SCRR of a non-returnable product (ASIN) and category will be updated on the Custom Business Report section in your account on Seller Central within 7 days of maturity. For example, the SCRR refunds data for orders shipped from 16 November, 2021 to 15 December, 2021, and refunded by the end of 31 December, 2021 will be updated from 1 January, 2022 to 7 January, 2022.

Starting 16 November, 2021, the SCRR for non-returnable products will be evaluated at both the category level and the product (ASIN) level. We will provide you with a category and ASIN target SCRR percentage, and if your category-level or your ASIN-level SCRR percentage is higher than the respective target percentage, you may be charged for the refund issued to buyers.

**Note:** You will not be charged twice for the same instance of a refund issued to a buyer. The SCRR evaluation is first completed at the category level, and categories that are not charged for refunds issued to buyers are then evaluated at the ASIN level. We will also provide the details of the orders for which seller-controllable refunds were issued. For these orders, we reserve the right to charge you for any of those refunds. To prevent seller-controllable returns and enable better performance metrics, please follow customer-friendly selling practices, such as high-quality packaging, dunnage, and other remedial actions.

#### Q6. When will my account be charged for SCRR refunds?

Your account may be charged if a customer refund is issued for a defect that could have been avoided at your end, and is not attributable to Amazon. Based on your selling history, customer feedback, information about gaps, if any, at our end, and other data available, a defect may be identified as one that is attributable or controllable by you as the seller.

We will evaluate your SCRR over an assessment period as detailed above (FAQ.5) and provide you with a report of your selling performance specifically with respect to product defects that could have been avoided.

#### Q7. How will I get the details of the orders where my account has been charged for SCRR refunds?

When we charge you the refund amount, in the event of a buyer return because of a seller-controllable defect, we will inform you about such charges by sending you an email. Additionally, when SCRR refunds have been charged to you, we will also upload details of the order where SCRR refunds have been charged to you, on the Custom Business Report section on Seller Central.

#### Q8. Will I able to raise reimbursement claim for such charges?

No, you will not be eligible for reimbursements for SCRR buyer refunds. Safe-T claims and reimbursement claims will ordinarily be declined, and we will claw back any reimbursements that have already been granted for such refunds.
