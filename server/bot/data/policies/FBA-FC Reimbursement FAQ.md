## General FAQ

#### 1\. How is the Fair Market Value Estimated?

We consider several factors when determining an item's fair market value, including your sales history, the average FBA selling price on Amazon, the applicable Amazon grading standards, the sales history of the specific ASIN and the applicable rate of taxes etc. If we don’t have enough information to calculate the reimbursement amount for an item, we will assign a value to your inventory based on similar items.

**Note:**

-   If you request a re-evaluation of your reimbursement, we may require more information from you, such as a receipt or invoice. The request for re-evaluation of the reimbursement must be filed within 60 days from the date of original reimbursement. [Link](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/help/hub/support/describe) to contact us for re-valuation.
-   For the purposes of computing the reimbursements, in no event will the fair market value for an individual item exceed INR 1,00,000, which applies to all product categories. For individual items with fair market value greater than INR 1,00,000, we recommend considering third-party insurance.

**Effective Reimbursement Value** = (Effective Reimbursement rate) x \[(Fair Market Value of unit) - (Amazon SOA and FBA Fees)\]

#### 2\. How is the effective reimbursement value calculated?

Effective reimbursement value = (Effective Reimbursement rate) x \[(Fair Market Value of unit)- (Amazon SOA and FBA Fees)\]
