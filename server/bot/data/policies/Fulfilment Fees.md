Lego Turtles toy set, price INR 6,249, Dimensions: 11.2 x 10.2 x 5.7 cm, Actual weight: 180 g. Based on the item size classification, this is determined to be a **standard size unit**.

By routing shipment orders through a small handful of IXD nodes, we can consolidate freight, leverage economies of scale for high volume receiving, and spread individual ASINs to a far wider range of fulfilment centres. This would otherwise be possible with a traditional direct ordering method. IXDs are sometimes referred to as receive centres.</td></tr></tbody></table>
