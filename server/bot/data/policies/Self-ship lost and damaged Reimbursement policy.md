[Reimbursements for damaged or wrong returns](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/help/hub/reference/G201310610#mnd_2jc_jcb-1)

Amazon does not take any liability for products that are damaged or lost in the seller’s premises and will not pay for or entertain any claims for reimbursement from sellers to that effect. This policy only addresses orders that were shipped on Self-Ship programme where the customer return picked by Amazon was either not returned to the seller (lost in transit) or returned by Amazon in an unsellable condition (damaged). In both these scenarios, your selling account should have already been debited to pay the customer refund.

For more information on returns and refund, go to [Returns and refund Policy](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/G201723330).

## Lost item reimbursement

If a self-shipped unit where the customer return has not been returned to the seller, Amazon will investigate to locate the returned Unit using its internal tracking system. Based on the investigation result, either the unit will be returned to the selling account or the seller will be reimbursed in case the unit is determined to be lost. Selling account is credited with the evaluated fair market value of your lost inventory, less any applicable Self-Ship and selling on Amazon fees = Reimbursement value.

Based on Amazon’s internal tracking systems and processes, sellers will be proactively reimbursed for the following cases:

1.  For all units where the seller was debited for customer refund that are not returned to seller even after 30 days from the refund date, Amazon will reimburse seller proactively within 50 days from the refund date.
2.  For units with replacement or exchange, if the original orders not returned to the seller even after 30 days from the replacement or exchange ship date, Amazon will reimburse seller proactively within 50 days from the date on which the replacement or exchange order was shipped.

**Note:**

-   It is to further clarify that the assessment of delivery status of all return units will be based on Amazon’s internal tracking system and processes.
-   It is the responsibility of a seller to file a [SAFE-T claims](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/G201988660) for reimbursement in either of these scenarios:
    
    -   Do not agree with the delivery status provided by Amazon
    -   Not already reimbursed, whereas they believe that it should have been proactively reimbursed.

## Reimbursements for damaged or wrong returns

Sellers can file SAFE-T claims for reimbursement losses incurred due to wrong return also known as switcheroo return, or damaged returns received from customers, for:

-   Return like fake or dummy product, main unit missing, empty box and materially different returns are reimbursed under the Reimbursement policy.
-   Returns which are unsellable, damaged are reimbursed under the Reimbursement policy.

For more information on reimbursement policy, go to [Reimbursement rates for SAFE-T claims](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/GHKVUTJTHUN7435L).

To be eligible for investigation for reimbursement, sellers must:  

1.  Raise SAFE-T claims within 15 days of returns received by seller.
2.  Submit images of the wrong or damaged return received.
3.  Submit images of packing labels of the return products which contains the order ID of the shipment.
4.  In case there are multiple units in an order ID and all of them were returned as switcheroo or damaged, sellers are expected to share an image with all the different units received and mention the number of wrong units in the comments section.

## Important notes

  

1.  For returns picked by Amazon: A refund will be issued to the buyer once the returned item has been picked up from buyer’s location. For order value above INR 25,000, you will have to issue a manual refund once you receive the product.
2.  For returns self-shipped by buyers: You are expected to issue refunds which are self-returned by customers. If you miss doing this within two days of receiving the item, Amazon Customer Support can refund buyers.
3.  Self-Ship orders with order value greater than INR 25,000 and orders which are a part of categories, such as Furniture, Musical instruments, Tyres, Jewellery, Sports are not eligible for SAFE-T claims. For more information, go to [Return and customer service experience for Self-Ship order](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/GM3TMRFRYJ4TANB8).

## Additional information

  

1.  For precious jewellery category, sellers are required to capture video of packing the customer order where the forward shipping label is visible and unboxing of the returns where the return label is visible. Upload these videos as proofs if you have to file a SAFE-T claim.
2.  Amazon will identify certain sellers from time to time and notify them to install CCTVs or cameras to record order processing at their premises and provide them as proofs to support their SAFE-T claims.
3.  The CCTV or camera recordings for a claim should cover the following steps for the claimed unit:
    
    -   Packing process of the item
    -   Handing over of the package to the carriers
    -   Receiving of the shipment from the carriers
    -   Opening of the return
    

At any point in time, if you are identified to have breached the terms of these return and refund policies, or are found to be engaged in any fraudulent activity to avail such a refund, then we will retain the right to recover such reimbursement amounts and take any action as per [Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/G1791) .

## Fair market value

All reimbursements, including reimbursement for lost or rejected or undeliverable shipments, will be based on fair market value as per the sole discretion of Amazon. While determining the <sup>1</sup>reimbursement value, the product taxes applied on an order and any applicable selling on Amazon (SOA) fees (including the closing fees) and any applicable Easy Ship fees are deducted from fair market value.

**Note:**

<sup>1</sup>Effective Reimbursement Value = (Effective Reimbursement Rate<sup>2</sup>) x \[(Fair Market Value of unit) - (Amazon SOA and Easy Ship fees)\]<sup>2</sup> Only for SAFE-T claim for return of damaged products, Amazon may at its sole discretion, reimburse the seller based on the above-mentioned factor of effective reimbursement rate.

<sup>*</sup>Fair market value is a dynamic input based on an algorithm computed by Amazon, keeping a number of factors in mind, used to calculate and determine what could amount to a fair price for the unit. This may include your current sales, past sale and category averages.
