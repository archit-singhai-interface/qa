## Seller Flex Reimbursements policy

Amazon does not take any liability for products that are damaged or lost in the sellerâ€™s premises and will not pay for or entertain any claims for reimbursement from sellers to that effect. This policy only addresses cases wherein an item that was handed over to Amazon for fulfilment using the Seller Flex programme was either not returned to the seller (lost in transit) or returned by Amazon in an unsellable condition (damaged). In both these scenarios, the seller account should have already been debited to pay the customer refund.
