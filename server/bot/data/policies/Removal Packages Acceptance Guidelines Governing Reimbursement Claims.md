## Differentiating a removal order ID and shipment ID

A new removal order generates a removal order ID. To optimally process your removal orders, it is sometimes split and processed in multiple shipments. The split is governed by multiple factors such as the quantity, volume and weight of the inventory requested to be removed. Each of these shipments have a common removal order ID, unique shipment IDs and corresponding tracking IDs using which you can track the estimated delivery date for the respective shipment. The processing of your removal order can be considered complete if all shipments associated with your removal order have been delivered successfully.

**Example**: If you want to remove 100 units of ASIN B00XXXXXX for removal order xi2j96XXXX, it can be processed in two shipments, 12345XXXX and 5678XXXX respectively with each shipment containing 50 units of the product each.

## Mandatory checks before accepting a delivery

It is important that the checks outlined in the following section are followed thoroughly at the time of the shipment handover in order to help us facilitate a friction-free and expedited reimbursement claim-settlement process.

-   **Ship To address**: Check the packing slip on the box to ensure that the **_Ship To_** address on the packing slip is the same as the address selected at the time of creating a removal order. In case of mismatch in the **_Ship To_** address, you are authorized to refuse to accept the package, inform our carrier partners and record the same on the Proof of Delivery (POD). The POD has to be signed off by both the concerned parties thus acknowledging the incident. The POD along with the reason for package refusal and signatures of the consignee and consignor are used by Amazon to validate and process your reimbursement claims.
-   **Package condition**: All removal orders shipped out of our fulfilment centres have Amazon-branded tape fastened at the top, bottom and sides of the box. We specifically seal all open sides to minimize any chances of pilferage during transit. Inspect all six sides of the box for signs of damage or tampering. If you identify any signs of box being tampered or any other tape apart from the Amazon-branded tape being used at the time of delivery, this needs to be reported on the POD and signed off both by the consignee and consignor.
-   **Quantity delivered**: Our carriers will provide you the ability to unbox the units and count them only if there are visual signs of damage/tampering observed on the package or if the package seems suspicious in any manner. You may then tally the delivered quantity with the expected quantity and report any discrepancies on the Proof of Delivery (POD) at the time of delivery itself. Any deviation in the quantity delivered versus expected from the shipment should be documented on the POD and signed off both by the consignor (carrier) and the consignee (vendor).
    
    **Note:** Do not request for unboxing of packages that do not have any visual signs of damage/tampering or are not suspicious.
    
    The quantity of discrepancy should be captured on the POD at an item level in the following format:
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tracking ID</th>
      <th>ASIN/FNSKU</th>
      <th>Quantity Received/Expected</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
    
**Example**: If a shipment 119132XXX with tracking ID 5050455XXXX carrying ten units of ASIN B00XXXXXX when physically counted at the time of delivery contains only eight units, the POD should capture the following comments to acknowledge the same:
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tracking ID</th>
      <th>ASIN/FNSKU</th>
      <th>Quantity Received/Expected</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>5050455XXXX</td>
      <td>B00XXXXXX</td>
      <td>8/10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
    
**Note:** It is also recommended to have a unique company seal and use the same on POD documents when accepting packages. This adds a basic level of security and serves as the proof in case of any disputes with respect to the package delivery.
    

## Reporting issues during delivery

-   If you encounter any of the aforementioned issue at the time of the package delivery, it should be reported to the carrier representative and recorded on the POD in the form of comments. The package should be accepted if and only if the issue encountered is recorded on the POD and signed off both by the consignee and the consignor.
-   Only a POD that clearly captures your comments, signatures of the representatives from both the parties available at the time of delivery will be considered as a valid POD. You can file a reimbursement claim along with the POD to support the claim within seven days from the shipment-delivery date. For more information, refer to the [FBA Lost and Damaged Inventory Reimbursement Policy](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/G200213130) help page.

**Important:** All removal-related claims submitted with Amazon for reimbursement should be supported by a valid POD. Claims filed without a valid POD might result in your claims being denied.

## Mandatory documents and information to be submitted while filing a lost/damage claim

-   Removal Order ID
-   Tracking ID.
-   FNSKUs missing
-   Image of entire shipping label (displays tracking ID & weight of the shipment)
-   Copy of the POD which calls out that units were received short.
-   Image of the outer box if there are any signs of tampering (If available)

## Optional documents

-   Images of the delivery challan.
-   Video showing you accepting the package from the delivery associate and identifying the damage or quantity discrepancy at the time of handover. This help us in faster resolution of claims, if any.
