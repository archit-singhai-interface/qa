Please refer to [COVID-19 Reimbursements Policy](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/G8PJDJKTK3U82L7W) help page for temporary changes to the policy owing to COVID-19.

Use the self-service FBA Reimbursement tool to understand if your order is eligible for a reimbursement.

We maintain high standards when it comes to taking care of your inventory. However, occasionally accidents do happen. If your inventory is damaged when it is under Amazon's control (damaged by an Amazon partnered Carrier, in the Fulfilment Centre, during provision of storage services by Amazon, during delivery to your Customer or damaged by Customer), then we will:

Pay you the Reimbursement as a percentage of evaluated fair market value of your damaged inventory, less any applicable FBA and Selling on Amazon Fees (subject to applicable grading standards utilised by Amazon).

Effective reimbursement value = (Effective Reimbursement rate<sup>1</sup>) x \[(Fair Market Value of unit) - (Amazon SOA and FBA Fees)\]

<sup>1</sup>Please check [Reimbursement\_Rates\_And\_Grade\_Based\_Reimbursements](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/202061610).

## What is covered by this policy?

-   Both New and Used or Certified Refurbished items that are damaged by the Carriers during delivery to Customers, return pick-up from the Customers and at time of removals.

## Removal Shipment Damaged

This process is used to address Seller's concern if there is Carrier responsible damage to units that have been or are in the process of being returned to the Seller on a Removal Order. Seller can raise a case by clicking on this [link](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/help/hub/support/describe) within 7 days from shipment delivery date.

Below is the information required for raising a request for this issue:

-   Removal Order ID
-   ASIN/FNSKU of the damaged unit
-   Image of Outer box in which the removal was delivered
-   Image of the damaged unit received (One or two images which clearly depicts the damage)
-   If multiple units are damaged, then place them all together and provide us an image where we should be able to identify the damage and also the number of units damaged (1, 2 images to cover all the damaged units).

In addition, we may request and require a Seller to provide CCTV recordings/Video Evidence to substantiate their claims.

The CCTV recordings/Video Evidence for a claim should cover the following steps for the claimed unit:

-   Overview of the box received and a view of all sides of the box
-   Unpacking process of the outer box
-   Unpacking contents inside the box
-   Opening each item inside the box and displaying the unit received inside.

All the steps should clearly show the product and package/shipping labels to identify the order and shipment details. In case the Seller fails to provide the CCTV recordings/Video Evidence, the Seller claims may be declined.

For more information on how to accept removal packages and report damage claims for the packages accepted, please refer to the [Removal Packages Acceptance Guidelines Governing Reimbursement Claims](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/GWK2QPNZYNWUJY9F) help page.

Failure to comply with Amazon policies as outlined above may result in the denial of your reimbursement claims, in Amazon's sole discretion. Our policies prohibit any activity that would interfere with our capacity to help other Sellers. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, submitting insufficiently researched or prematurely submitted requests, or submitting high volumes of requests in a short period of time. All disputes to the case resolution provided must be submitted within 7 days from case closure date with valid reasons and supporting documentation.
