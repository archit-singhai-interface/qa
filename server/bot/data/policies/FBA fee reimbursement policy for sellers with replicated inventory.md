Effective from December 01, 2020, there is a change in the FBA fee reimbursement policy in the method used to determine the reimbursement amount for weight handling fee for sellers who replicate inventory across regions. As per the revised methodology, Amazon will reimburse INR 20 (plus 18% GST) computed for every shipment instead of units, shipped nationally. This change is in-line with our Weight Handling Fee Changes which were effective from December 01, 2020. On the basis of the new policy, seller needs to have replicated sellable inventory available in the same region (as classified below) as of the customer delivery location for all the ASINs (in the shipped quantity) in that shipment.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Region 1</td><td><p>Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab,</p><p>Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh-Zone A*, Uttarakhand</p></td></tr><tr><td>Region 2</td><td>Dadra and Nagar, Diu and Daman, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra</td></tr><tr><td>Region 3</td><td><p>Andaman and Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Pondicherry,</p><p>Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Lakshadweep</p></td></tr><tr><td>Region 4</td><td><p>Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Meghalaya,</p><p>Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh-Zone B**, West Bengal</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

**\*\*Uttar Pradesh-Zone B:** The following administrative divisions will be considered as part of 'Uttar Pradesh-Zone B' - Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Basti, Devipatan, Gorakhpur, Mirzapur, Prayagraj and Varanasi.

**\*Uttar Pradesh-Zone A:** All administrative divisions in the state of Uttar Pradesh that are not part of 'Uttar Pradesh-Zone B'.

**Note:** All the ASINs (in the shipped quantity) in the shipment will need to be present in the Customer delivery location for it to be eligible for reimbursements. This policy is applicable at a Seller shipment level.

Revised method is illustrated through the following example:

On December 21, 2020, 120 shipments of a seller were shipped nationally and accordingly you were charged a National Weight Handling Fee for these shipments. If 100 shipments where all the ASINs in these shipments are available (quantity as per the shipment size) in regions corresponding to the delivery location at the time of shipment, then we will reimburse you for these 100 shipments, at INR 20 per shipment amounting to INR 2,360 (Indian Rupees Two Thousand Three Hundred and Sixty only) including 18% GST. This amount is calculated using the formula given below:

Weight Handling Fee Reimbursement Amount = 100 x 20 + 100\* (20\*18%)

\= 2000 + 360

\= INR 2360

The reimbursement will be processed by February 28, 2021 for shipments shipped in December 2020.
