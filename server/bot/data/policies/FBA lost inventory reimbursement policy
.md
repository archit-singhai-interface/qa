This process is used to address your concerns if your item is lost in the Amazon network while on the way to getting delivered to the customer, or on the way to return to fulfilment centre as Customer return or Reject items. The reimbursement will be issued automatically if the unit is not returned to the fulfilment centre within 45 days from the date of refund to customer.

If we have previously reimbursed you for lost inventory that is subsequently found, or otherwise determine that the reimbursement was given by mistake, then you authorise us to reverse the credit that was applied to your account. For more details on this policy, go to [Reimbursements FAQ](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/DC45KH55MEW85WT).

## Missing from Inbound (MFI)

The objective of the process is to locate and recover inventory that has been reported missing at some stage of receiving your shipment at the fulfilment centre. In case your shipment has been delivered or checked in but has not been added to inventory within 14 days from the receive date, you can reconcile your FBA shipments.

Raise the claim 14 days after the inventory receive date and within 60 days of the inventory receive date. For more information, go to [Reconcile your shipment](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/external/G201214140).

## PCP Reimbursements under MFI

In case you have used Partnered Carrier Programme services to transport your items to the fulfilment centre and it has not been received at the fulfilment centre within 14 business days from pick-up date, it will be proactively auto-reimbursed. You will receive an e-mail notification with details on shipments lost in transit.

These proactive reimbursements are applicable only for shipments where we are unable to see a delivery or checked-in status, 14 business days from pick-up date. For shipments that were having delivered or checked-in status but units were not fully received, you can contact Selling Partner Support for the missing units.

## Lost in fulfilment centre

This process is used to calculate inventory deviations within a sellerâ€™s inventory to determine the cause and validity of suspected loss. Reconciliations are calculated by subtracting existing and outgoing inventory, such as sales, removals, credits, legitimate adjustments from the total amount of received inventory.

The basic formula is: (Total Received Inventory + Returns) - Sales - Removals - Adjustments - Credits = Final Result.

For information on missing units, go to [Inventory Ledger](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/reportcentral/LEDGER_REPORT/0).

If a misplaced unit is not found as per the Inventory adjustment report, [contact us](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/help/center) to investigate for the missing units. Raise a claim within 60 days of the Inventory adjustment date.
