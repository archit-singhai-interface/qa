## FBA-FC Switcheroo or Materially Different Return Inventory Reimbursement Policy

This policy outlines how Sellers can seek reimbursement when units received by the Seller do not match with the units requested in the FBA Removal Order. Sellers must submit a claim within 30 days of delivery of the shipment using the [link](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/help.html?itemID=https://sellercentral.amazon.in/help/hub/support/describe).

## Submit a claim

Use the [support tool](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/help/help.html?itemID=https://sellercentral.amazon.in/help/hub/support/describe) to submit a reimbursement claim. Please include the following information in your claim:

-   Removal Order ID
-   Tracking ID
-   Image of the unit received
-   Image of Licence Plate Number (LPN) label or FNSKU on the unit (mandatory for unsellable removals from large Fulfilment Centres (FC) / Amazon Fulfilment Technologies (AFT), such as HYD8, BLR5)
-   Image of LPN is not mandatory if the disposition of the unit in the Removal Order is Sellable

Amazon may ask the Seller to provide CCTV recordings or other video evidence to substantiate the claim. CCTV recordings/video evidence for the claim must show the following:

-   Overview of the box received and a view of all sides of the box
-   Unpacking process of the outer box
-   Unpacking contents inside the box
-   Opening each item inside the box and displaying the unit received inside.

Product and shipping labels must be clearly shown. Claims submitted without CCTV recordings/video evidence may be declined.

## Track your claim

Check the reimbursement report to find out if you have been reimbursed for your claim. You can access the reimbursement report from [Amazon Fulfilled Reports](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/gp/ssof/reports.html/ref=ag_fbareports_dnav_myo_#orderAscending=&recordType=&noResultType=&inventoryAdjustmentReasonGroup=&merchantSku=&fnSku=&skuType=merchantSku&FnSkuXORMSku=&reimbursementId=&orderId=&genericOrderId=&asin=&lpn=&shipmentId=&hazmatStatus=&inventoryEventTransactionType=&fulfillmentCenterId=&transactionItemId=&eventDateOption=1&fromDate=dd%2Fmm%2Fyyyy&toDate=dd%2Fmm%2Fyyyy&startDate=&endDate=&fromMonth=10&fromYear=2019&toMonth=10&toYear=2020&startMonth=&startYear=&endMonth=&endYear=&specificMonth=9&specificYear=2020).
