## Requirement matrix for SAFE-T claims

The different documents required to process SAFE-T claims are mentioned in the following table.

The requirement matrix is aimed at improving the seller experience and reducing the processing time for reimbursement requests. It identifies different scenarios in which a seller may raise a reimbursement request. It also lists the various documents and evidence required by Amazon to process the request for each of these scenarios. Sellers can refer to the matrix to identify all supporting documents and evidence required while raising reimbursement requests, reducing the processing time.

**\*You can check the status of return on Seller Flex WMS or data received from an integrator for stores or warehouse integration sites (as applicable).**

On customer returns, if you suspect that the product inside the outer package is different than what was shipped, you can record an unboxing video. The video must clearly show the return mailing label and all sides of the package, serving as an additional proof on your SAFE-T claim.

**Note:** At any point in time, a claim may be rejected if a seller is found to have submitted proofs that are:

-   Non-authentic
-   False
-   Misleading
-   Tampered
-   Same as the proof submitted on a previous claim
-   Submitted on a different product
