Handmade sellers pay a referral fee on each product sold. The referral fee is
either a flat percentage rate or a per-item minimum fee, whichever is greater.
They do not pay both. This fee is in addition to other fees (like FBA or
shipping charges). Therefore, the overall fee may be higher than the
percentage listed below.

The flat percentage fee is based on the total amount paid by the buyer
including the item price and any shipping or gift-wrap charges, but excluding
any taxes collected through Amazon tax calculation services.

¹Sellers pay a referral fee on each product sold.

These referral fees apply only to approved Amazon Handmade sellers with a
Professional selling plan. If you are an approved Handmade seller, but have
not upgraded to a Professional selling plan, you are subject to Amazon’s
standard referral fees.

**Note:** Once you are approved to sell in the Amazon Handmade store and
approved for a Professional selling plan , the Professional selling plan fee
is waived going forward, for as long as you are approved to sell in Amazon
Handmade and have eligible products for sale. For more information on the
