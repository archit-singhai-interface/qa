items in your FBA inventory stored at an Amazon fulfillment center. You can
also remove inventory from a fulfillment center by submitting a removal order.

## Values used to calculate fee

**Product size tier** | Product size tiers are measurement categories based on the unit weight, product dimensions, and dimensional weight of a packaged item. Learn how to [determine your product-size tier](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W), or use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/gp/ssof/reports/search.html?recordType=STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES&language=en_US&ref=au_fbafulrpts_cont_G5FKTA8LXU4TZPD5) to see the size tier information for products you have previously stored in FBA.

**Shipping weight** | Shipping weight is the item weight to ship an order of the item. The shipping weight is calculated based on the itemâ€™s unit weight or dimensional weight, depending on size tier and whichever is greater. Learn how to [determine your product's shipping weight](/gp/help/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY).  
  
## Rate cards

Use the size tier of your product to determine which rate card applies. If
your product requires special handling*, then use the **Oversize and special
handling items** rate card.

**Note:** Shipping weight in the standard-size tiers under 1 lb is calculated
by rounding up to the nearest 0.1 lb. For the remaining size tiers, the
shipping weight is calculated by rounding up to the nearest whole pound.

Size tier | Shipping weight | Disposal fee per unit  
---|---|---  
**Standard size** | 0 to 0.5 lb | $1.04  
0.5+ to 1.0 lb | $1.53  
1.0+ to 2.0 lb | $2.27  
More than 2 lb | $2.89 + $1.06/lb above 2 lb  
**Large bulky, extra-large and special handling items*** | 0 to 1.0 lb | $3.12  
1.0+ to 2.0 lb | $4.30  
2.0+ to 4.0 lb | $6.36  
4.0+ to 10.0 lb | $10.04  
More than 10.0 lb | $14.32 + $1.06/lb above 10 lb  
  
*Large bulky and extra-large are previously called oversize. Special handling items may include apparel, shoes, watches, jewelry, and dangerous goods.

## Fee examples

**Example 1: Standard-size item, shipping weight of 0.5+ to 1.0 lb**

You request the disposal of two standard-size units, and each unit has a
shipping weight of 0.56 lb. The unit's shipping weight is rounded up to 0.6
lb. Given that the unit has a shipping weight between 0.5 and 1 lb, the per-
unit disposal fee is $1.53. You will be charged a disposal fee of $1.53 per
unit, for a total of $3.06, when the disposal order is complete.

**Example 2: Oversize item, shipping weight over 10.0 lb**

You request the disposal of three oversize units, and each unit has a shipping
weight of 10.1 lb. The unit's shipping weight is rounded up to 11 lb. The
resulting per-unit disposal fee will be $15.38 ($14.32 for the first 10 lb and
$1.06 for the additional 1 lb). You will be charged a disposal fee of $15.38
per unit, for a total of $46.14, when the disposal order is complete.
