Dangerous goods are substances or materials that may pose a risk when storing,
handling, or transporting because they contain flammable, pressurized,
corrosive, or otherwise harmful substances. These product types can include
consumer electronics, beauty and personal care products, automotive parts and
accessories, and more.

To prevent potential health and safety risks, we gather dangerous goods
information related to any product sold in our stores. It’s your
responsibility to ensure that any of your shipments that contain dangerous
goods comply with local and international transportation regulations when you
are the shipper of record.

Scenarios where you’re the shipper of record include but are not limited to
the follow cases:

  * When you ship products to our fulfillment centers
  * When you ship items to customers directly

**Note:** You are not the shipper of record when we ship products to customers
as part of the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program.

Noncompliance with our dangerous goods policy can pose serious safety risks.
Any violation of dangerous goods regulations or this policy will result in
corrective actions, including but not limited to deactivation of your seller-
fulfilled or Amazon-fulfilled offers or account deactivation.
