This report shows a near real-time snapshot of your inventory in Amazon’s
fulfillment centers at the time the report is run.  
  
This report will provide the inventory quantities, conditions and locations
across Amazon’s fulfillment centers throughout North America (NA). This is a
downloadable report only. The online view of this report is not available.

As customers may purchase your products at any time, quantities displayed in
an inventory report only provide a snapshot of your inventory and may be out
of date almost as soon as the report is requested. To reconcile your inventory
levels, compare your country-specific orders and inventory reports in Seller
Central to your own inventory records.

This report only displays your in-stock, sellable products (products that are
out of stock or unsellable are not taken into account).
