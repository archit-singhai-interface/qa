Amazon charges monthly inventory storage fees for the space your inventory
occupies in fulfillment centers. Monthly storage fees are calculated on your
daily average volume in cubic feet, based on the size of a unit that is
properly packaged and ready to ship in accordance with [FBA policies and
requirements](/gp/help/G201030350). Monthly storage fees consist of the
following fee components:  

  1. Base monthly storage fee, which is determined by product size and time of year.
  2. Storage utilization surcharge, which is in addition to the base monthly storage fee, and varies based on product size and storage utilization ratio. The surcharge only applies to sellers who meet the eligibility criteria outlined below.

Fees for inventory that is classified as dangerous goods are assessed using
different rates. Review the [Dangerous Goods Identification
Guide](/gp/help/G201003400) to determine if your inventory is considered
dangerous goods.

**Program specifics:** The details, calculations, or rates for this fee vary
if enrolled in the following programs:

## Fee details

Time of charge | Monthly, typically between the 7th and 15th day of the month, in the month following when the fees were incurred.  
---|---  
Fee components | Base monthly storage fee and storage utilization surcharge.  
Fee structure | Per usage of storage, based on the daily average volume for the space your inventory occupies in fulfillment centers. Rate based on product type, size-tier, time of year, and storage utilization ratio.  
  
## Base monthly storage fee

Base monthly storage fee is charged to all inventory in fulfillment centers.
Charges vary based on product size tier and time of year.

## Storage utilization surcharge

Some sellers are also subject to a storage utilization surcharge in addition
to the base monthly storage fee. This surcharge aligns our fees with
underlying costs to serve impacted sellers. The surcharge is based on the
storage utilization ratio, which is the ratio of your average daily inventory
volume stored divided by the average daily shipped volume during the past 13
weeks. The ratio is calculated for each product size tier, which means you may
have a storage utilization ratio for standard-size and a different storage
utilization ratio for oversize. You can view your latest storage utilization
ratio on [FBA Dashboard](/fba/dashboard).

The surcharge is only applicable if you meet all of the following criteria:  

  1. You have a Professional selling account
  2. Your first shipment to an Amazon fulfillment center in the US was more than 365 days ago
  3. Your average daily inventory volume for the product size tier is at or above 25 cubic feet 
  4. Your storage utilization ratio for the product size tier is above 26 weeks

If you meet the above criteria, a storage utilization surcharge will be
applied to all inventory in fulfillment centers aged above 30 days, and added
to your base monthly storage fee. If you do not meet any of the criteria, you
will only be charged a base monthly storage fee.

For more information on the storage utilization surcharge, including how to
reduce the surcharge, go to the **Frequently asked questions** section.

## Values used to calculate fee

**Product size tier** | Product size tiers are measurement categories based on the unit weight, product dimensions, and dimensional weight of a packaged item. Learn how to [determine your product-size tier](/help/hub/reference/G201105770), or use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/help/hub/reference/G202086720) to see the size tier information for products you have previously stored in FBA.  
---|---  
**Current month** | Storage fees vary by time of year based on shopping seasons as outlined in the **Rates** section below.  
**Product volume** | Product dimensions and volume (which equals to longest side x median side x shortest side) are measured when a product is fully packaged and ready to ship in accordance with [FBA policies and requirements](/gp/help/201030350). Monthly inventory storage fees are calculated by cubic meter. Use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/help/hub/reference/G202086720) to see the product volume for products you have previously stored with FBA.  
**Average daily units** | Fees are based on the average number of units stored in FBA per month, minus the average number of units pending removal. Use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/help/hub/reference/G202086720) to see the average daily units for your products stored in FBA for previous months.  
**Storage utilization ratio** | The ratio of your average daily inventory volume stored divided by the average daily shipped volume during the past 13 weeks. Storage utilization ratio on the last day of a given month is used to determine the storage utilization surcharge rate for inventory stored during that month. Use the FBA dashboard to see your latest storage utilization ratio and Monthly Storage Fees report to see the storage utilization ratio used in monthly storage fees charged in previous months.  
**Dangerous goods classification status** | Products that can be sold only through the [FBA Dangerous Goods program](/gp/help/GZLZBQ7W6QZRKWWK) require special handling and storage. Use the [look up an ASIN tool](/gp/help/G201003400) to check the classification status of your ASIN and whether it requires enrollment in the FBA Dangerous Goods program.

## Fee example

**Formula** | Fee per product = average daily units x volume per unit x applicable rate  
---|---  
**Example 1: Sellers that do not meet storage utilization surcharge criteria**  
**Sample product** | 

  * Size tier: Standard size 
  * Storage utilization ratio for the size tier: 14 weeks
  * Current month: July 
  * Volume per unit: 0.05 cubic feet 
  * Average daily units in storage: 100 
  * Average daily units in storage aged above 30 days: 20
  * Dangerous goods classification: Not a dangerous good 

  
**Calculation** | 

  * **Base monthly storage fees = 100** average units per month x **0.05** cubic feet per unit x **$0.78** per cubic foot (standard-size rate in July) = **$4.22** total monthly storage fees
  * Storage utilization surcharge = **$0** (no fee for storage utilization ratio below 22 weeks)
  * Total monthly storage fees = $4.22 + $0 = **$4.22**

  
**Example 2: Sellers that meet storage utilization surcharge criteria**  
**Sample product** | 

  * Size tier: Oversize 
  * Storage utilization ratio for the size tier: 25 weeks
  * Current month: July 
  * Volume per unit: 0.05 cubic feet 
  * Average daily units in storage: 100 
  * Average daily units in storage aged above 30 days: 10
  * Dangerous goods classification: Not a dangerous good 

  
**Calculation** | 

  * **100** average units per month x **0.05** cubic feet per unit x **$1.02** per cubic foot (oversize rate for storage utilization ratio between 22-28 weeks charged in July) = **$5.10** total monthly storage fees
  * **Base monthly storage fees =****100** average units per month x **0.05** cubic feet per unit x **$0.56** per cubic foot (standard-size rate in July) = **$2.80** total monthly storage fees
  * Storage utilization surcharge = **10** average units per month aged above 30 days x **0.05** cubic feet per unit x **$0.12** per cubic foot (standard-size rate in July) = **$0.12** total monthly storage fees
  * Total monthly storage fees = $2.80 + $0.12 = **$2.92**

## Frequently asked questions

**How is the storage utilization ratio calculated?**

The ratio is calculated by dividing average daily inventory volume stored by
average daily shipped volume over the past 13 weeks, and then dividing it by
number of days in a week. The formula for the ratio is: (Daily inventory
volume for the past 13 weeks / Daily shipped volume for the past 13 weeks) /
(7 days in a week). We include all inventory stored in fulfillment centers to
calculate the ratio, excluding pending removal volume. For each seller, we
calculate the ratio on product size tier level, which means that a seller may
have one storage utilization ratio for standard-size and a different storage
utilization ratio for oversize.

**How do I estimate my storage utilization ratio?**

Use the [FBA Dashboard](/fba/dashboard) to see your latest storage utilization
ratio. The dashboard shows your average daily inventory volume, average daily
shipped volume, and storage utilization ratio for each product size tier. The
dashboard will also indicate if you are nearing or exceeding the threshold for
the surcharge.

**How is the storage utilization ratio used in storage fee calculation?**

We use the storage utilization ratio from the last day of the month to
determine the surcharge for the inventory stored during that month. For
example, to determine the surcharge for April 2024, we will use the storage
utilization ratio from April 30. If the surcharge is applicable to a seller,
we will apply to surcharge to all inventory aged above 30 days stored in
fulfillment centers during that month. We will then add the surcharge to base
monthly storage fee. See below calculation for example:

Sample seller |  Size tier: Standard-size Current month: April Average daily inventory cube: 40,000 cubic feet Average daily shipped cube: 200 cubic feet  
---|---  
Seller surcharge utilization ratio | (40,000 cubic ft / 200 cubic ft) / 7 days in a week = 28.6 weeks  
Storage fee rates |  Base monthly storage fee to be applied to all inventory: **$0.78** per cubic foot (standard-size rate in April) Storage utilization surcharge to be applied to all inventory aged above 30 days: **$0.76** per cubic foot (standard-size surcharge for surcharge utilization ratio between 28-36 weeks in April)   
  
**How can I prevent getting the storage utilization surcharge?**

You can reduce your storage utilization ratio and minimize the surcharge by
reducing their stored inventory volume. You can improve your sell-through
rate, request a [liquidation order](/gp/help/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF), or request a
return or disposal order through a [removal order](/gp/help/G200280650).

You can also review the [Monthly Storage Fee
report](/reportcentral/STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES/1), which shows how your monthly
storage fee is broken out by base monthly storage fee and storage utilization
surcharge. You can use this report to see which SKUs historically drive your
storage costs, and reduce inventory on those SKUs.

**Will I still receive my FBA New Selection benefit with the introduction of
the storage utilization surcharge?**

[FBA New Selection](/gp/help/GWHQRT98SAZC29VQ) program offers eligible sellers
free monthly storage, free liquidations, and free return processing on
eligible products for a limited time. These benefits can help you launch new
products and allow you to recover value from excess inventory.

If you are enrolled in FBA New Selection program and your units are eligible
for free monthly storage, those units will not be factored into your base
monthly storage fee and storage utilization surcharge.

**Will the storage utilization surcharge apply to products auto-replenished by
Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD)?**

Starting June 1, 2024, products that are auto-replenished by Amazon
Warehousing and Distribution (AWD) are eligible for a storage utilization
surcharge waiver. For a product to become eligible for the waiver 70% or more
of the FBA inventory units must be auto-replenished in the past 13 weeks. This
Auto-Replenishment Ratio (ARR) will be calculated daily for each product. Run
a [FBA Surcharge Waiver Status report](/awd/fee/reporting) to confirm the
status (Waived/Not Waived) of each product.

**How will using AWD to auto-replenish products impact my storage utilization
ratio?**

Starting June 1, 2024, on the last day of the month, we’ll remove any products
that are auto-replenished with AWD and meet the above waiver requirements
before we calculate your storage utilization ratio. For example, all eligible
products as of June 30, 2024, will be removed from your storage utilization
ratio calculation for June 2024 surcharge.
