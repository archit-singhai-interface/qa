## Troubleshoot pricing and other listing errors

If you are having difficulty with identifying the cause of your pricing and
listing error, use the following tool:

Amazon detects potential pricing errors based on several factors including
legal or compliance issues, our Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and the
Featured Offer (Buy Box) price. When Amazon detects potential pricing errors
in your listings, we will notify you, and in more serious cases, might
deactivate the affected listings to avoid a potentially negative customer
experience. You can help avoid pricing errors by setting your offer price in
accordance to Amazonâ€™s [Marketplace Fair Price
Policies](/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V?).

You can identify deactivated listings using the following views:

  * Select [Pricing health](/pricing/health/ref=xx_xx_dnav_xx) from the **Pricing** drop-down menu
  * Click the **Inactive** option

**Note:** The Pricing health tool is not available for individual sellers.

To reactivate listings that have been deactivated because of potential pricing
errors, consider updating your offer price.

**Note:** If your new offer price is same as before or marginally different
from previous price, your offer might become inactive again due to a recurring
pricing error.

You can also choose to enroll your products in an [Automate Pricing
rule](/automatepricing/home/ref=xx_mars_dnav_xx) that automatically matches
the competitive price outside Amazon, increasing your likelihood of being the
Featured (Buy Box) Offer.

If you have more than one listing that needs to be fixed, upload an Inventory
loader or Price and Quantity feed.

**Amazon Business Sellers:** Price Alerts can be caused by potential errors in
your business prices or quantity discounts. See [Business Prices and quantity
discounts](/gp/help/201740300) for more information.
