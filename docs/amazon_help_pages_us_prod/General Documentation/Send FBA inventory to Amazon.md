When you're ready to send inventory to Amazon, you begin by creating a
shipping plan. A shipping plan specifies the following:  
  
  * Products you want to send to Amazon
  * Quantity of each product
  * Shipping method and carrier details
  * Whether or not you want to prepare and label your inventory yourself or have Amazon do it

##  Create your shipping plan

On this page, you can find information on the prerequisite step to creating
your shipping plan, selecting the products to send to Amazon.

After you have completed your shipment and sent it to Amazon, use the
[Shipping Queue](/gp/fba/inbound-queue/index.html/ref=id_xx_cont_fbashipq) to
track your shipment as it progresses through the fulfilment network.

##  Select products

  

  1. Go to [Manage inventory](/hz/inventory) and select each product that you want to ship. 

**Note:** To use this tool, make sure your SKUs are Fulfillment by Amazon
(FBA) SKUs. For more information on how to change a SKU from seller-fulfilled
to FBA or to edit a listing, go to [Edit a listing](/gp/help/SGKAPSNT53G5B2P).

  2. From the **Action on selected** drop-down menu, select **Send/replenish inventory**. 
  3. On the **Send/replenish inventory** page, choose one of the following: 
     * **Create a new shipping plan**
     * **Add to an existing shipping plan** to add products to an open shipping plan. Select an open plan from the **Add to shipping plan** drop-down menu.
  4. Confirm your ship-from address. Your ship-from address is the location where your shipment will be picked up. It can be your home or business. If you work with suppliers, it can be from their warehouse. To change the ship-from address, click **Ship from another address**.
  5. Confirm the packing type of the products you are shipping to Amazon. **Individual products** are single products of varying quantities and conditions. **Case-packed products** are multiples of the same product packaged by the manufacturer, where each case contains the same quantity in the same condition.

**Note:** An ASIN with multiple parts must be shipped in a single package.

  6. Click **Continue to shipping plan**.

After you select the products that you want to send, you are ready to set the
quantity for each product.

**Set quantity** is the first step in the six-step shipment creation process.  

  1. Set the quantity for shipment to Amazon
