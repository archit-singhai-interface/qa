**Note:** From October 15, 2024, to January 14, 2025, a holiday peak
fulfillment fee will be applied to all Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) orders
in the US. To view the peak period rates, go to [2024 Multi-Channel
Fulfillment holiday peak fulfillment
fee](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GU9APCGF6KETA8WC).  
  
**Attention:** On January 15, 2025, MCF’s updated non-peak period fees will go
into effect. To view the upcoming rates, go to [2025 fulfillment fees for
Multi-Channel Fulfillment orders](/help/hub/reference/GYPYM328XDEPGX6Y).

On this page, you will learn how to calculate fulfillment fees for orders
placed on websites other than Amazon. You will also learn how to determine
your product’s size tier and shipping weight. Learn more about our click-to-
delivery speeds by going to [Multi-Channel Fulfillment: Fulfill orders for

## Additional fees

**Note:** Effective April 1, 2024, a low-inventory-level fee will apply to
Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) outbound units, but it does not apply to MCF
outbound units. For more information, go to [Low-Inventory-level
fee](/gp/help/GV43F6S76Y9DHYRH).

Additional fees and surcharges may apply to MCF orders, which include the
following:

  * [Lithium batteries](/gp/help/G9RJJ3KFHSF6YRAG) and items that contain lithium batteries will incur an additional $0.11 per unit to the base fulfillment fee.
  * If you [block your MCF orders from being shipped by Amazon Logistics](/gp/help/G200332450#mnd_2jc_jcb-6), it will result in a 5% surcharge on your MCF orders.*
  * Any orders shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will include a remote area surcharge of 100% for standard-size items and 200% for large bulky and extra-large items.*
  * All non-fulfillment fees, such as storage, labeling, or fees to inbound and remove your inventory from Amazon fulfillment centers, will continue to be the same for MCF as for FBA. For more information, go to [FBA features, services, and fees](/gp/help/G201074400).

*The surcharges for blocking Amazon Logistics or for remote area delivery are calculated after adding any applicable lithium battery fees to the item’s base fulfillment fee.

## Examples of additional order fees

The following example illustrates the additional MCF fee structure for a
single-unit, small standard-size item (4+ to 8 oz) that is being shipped at
standard speed to Hawaii. The item contains a lithium battery and Amazon
Logistics is blocked as a carrier.

Single-unit order  
---  
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/fees/mobileDeviceCase._V522446436_.png) |  **E-book reader** Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.42 inches Unit weight: 5.56 oz Rounded shipping weight: 6 oz  
**Base fulfillment fee: small standard size (4+ to 8 oz)**  
**Standard delivery speed rate** | $7.15  
**Lithium battery fee** | $0.11  
**Total base fulfillment fee** | ($7.15 + $0.11) = **$7.26**  
**Additional surcharges**  
**Block Amazon Logistics** | ($7.26 x 5%) = $0.36  
**Remote area delivery** | ($7.26 x 100%) = $7.26  
**Total surcharges** | ($0.36 + $7.26) = **$7.62**  
****Total fulfillment fee****  
Base fulfillment fee ($7.26) + surcharges ($7.62) = **$14.88**  
  
The following example illustrates the additional MCF fee structure for a two-
unit order that contains one small standard-size item (4+ to 8 oz) and one
large standard-size item (1+ to 2 lb) that is being shipped at standard speed
to Hawaii. Both items contain lithium batteries and Amazon Logistics is
blocked as a carrier.

**Base fulfillment fee: small standard size (4+ to 8 oz)**  
**Two-unit standard delivery speed rate** | $4.92  
**Lithium battery fee** | $0.11  
**Total base fulfillment fee** | ($4.92 + $0.11) = **$5.03**  
**Base fulfillment fee: large standard size (1+ to 2 lb)**  
**Two-unit standard delivery speed rate** | $6.65  
**Lithium battery fee** | $0.11  
**Total base fulfillment fee** | ($6.65 + $0.11) = **$6.76**  
**Additional surcharges**  
**Block Amazon Logistics** | ($5.03 + $6.76) x 5% = $0.59  
**Remote area delivery** | ($5.03 + $6.76) x 100% = $11.79  
**Total surcharges** | ($0.59 + $11.79) = **$12.38**  
**Total fulfillment fee**  
Base fulfillment fees ($5.03 + $6.76) + surcharges ($12.38) = **$24.17**
