This page details upcoming changes to Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fulfillment
fees.

**Note:** From October 15, 2024, to January 14, 2025, the holiday peak
fulfillment fee will be applied to FBA (excluding apparel), apparel, and
dangerous goods. On January 15, 2025, FBA fulfillment fees will revert back to
the non-peak period rates, which are unchanged from the 2024 non-peak rates.

## Changes to size tiers and fees

Starting on February 5, 2024, the small standard-size tier will be measured at
intervals of 2 ounces and the large standard-size tier from 1+ to 20 lb will
be measured at intervals of 4 ounces. The changes won’t apply to Apparel
products. Additionally, the small, medium, large, and special oversize tiers
will be replaced by the new large bulky and extra-large size tiers with new
weight and dimensions definitions. See definitions of each size tier in the
below table. For more details, go to the [Product size
tiers](/gp/help/external/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W) page.

Product size tier | Greater of unit weight or dimensional weight | Longest side | Median side | Shortest side | Length + girth  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
**Small standard-size** | Up to 16 oz | Up to 15 inches | Up to 12 inches | Up to 0.75 inch | n/a  
**Large standard-size** | Up to 20 lb | Up to 18 inches | Up to 14 inches | Up to 8 inches | n/a  
**Large bulky** | Up to 50 lb | Up to 59 inches | Up to 33 inches | Up to 33 inches | Up to 130 inches  
**Extra-large 0 to 50 lb** | Up to 50 lb | Extra-large exceeds 59 inches for the longest side, 33 inches for the median side, 33 inches for the shortest side, or 130 inches for length + girth, or the product’s greater of unit weight or dimensional weight exceeds 50 lb.

calculate fees.

## Ships in Product Packaging

Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP) is a program in which products are shipped
to the customer in their original packaging, without any additional packaging
from Amazon. Products certified as SIPP will automatically receive lowered FBA
fulfillment fees on each certified unit shipped. Products may be certified by
Amazon if their packaging meets SIPP guidelines. For details on SIPP
guidelines and how to enroll, go to [SIPP enrollment
guidelines](/sustainability/program/sipp). Products smaller than 6 x 4 x 0.375
inches and classified as dangerous goods or extra-large items are not eligible
for SIPP discounted rates.

Starting February 5, 2024, the following discounted rates apply on 2024 FBA
fulfillment fees for SIPP-certified units.

## Low-inventory-level fee

We will apply a low-inventory-level fee to standard-sized products with
consistently low inventory relative to customer demand. When sellers carry low
inventory relative to shipped units, we’re unable to distribute products
across our network optimally, which reduces delivery speed and drives higher
shipping costs. The low-inventory-level fee will only apply if a product’s
historical inventory levels relative to historical demand (known as
“historical days of supply”) is below 28 days. If eligible, the low-inventory-
level fee will be added to the FBA fulfillment fee for its shipped units. Go
to [low-inventory-level fee](/help/hub/reference/external/GV43F6S76Y9DHYRH)
page for more details.

To determine fees, first determine a product’s size tier and then its shipping
weight. Shipping weight for calculating fees for small standard is based on
unit weight. Large standard uses greater of unit or dimensional weight. For
detailed definitions of each size tier, go to [product size

## Frequently asked questions

#### Will the 2025 fulfillment fees apply to products ordered before January
15, 2024?

FBA fulfillment fees are calculated and charged when shipments leave
fulfillment centers. If a product is ordered before January 15, 2025, but is
shipped on or after that date, the fulfillment fees indicated to start on
January 15, 2025, will apply.

#### How is dimensional weight calculated?

Dimensional weight is equal to the unit volume (length x width x height)
divided by 139. For large bulky and extra-large items, we assume a minimum
width and height of 2 inches. Amazon will use dimensional weight for fees when
it is greater than unit weight for all large standard, large bulky, and extra-
large (except 150+ lb) units. Small standard and extra-large 150+ lb units
will use unit weight for fees.

#### How do I determine what product size tier my product belongs to?

Use the [size tiers table](/gp/help/external/G201105770) to determine your
product's size tier.
