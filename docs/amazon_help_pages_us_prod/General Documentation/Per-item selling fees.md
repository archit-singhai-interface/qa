## Frequently asked questions

#### When would the per-item fee with an Individual selling plan be better
than a Professional selling plan?

At a pay-as-you-go rate of $0.99 per item, you would need more than 40 sales
per month to offset the $39.99 subscription fee for the Professional selling
plan (40 x $0.99 per-item selling fee = $39.60). If you have fewer than 40
sales per month, or if you have seasonal fluctuations in your sales, the
Individual selling plan may be right for you.

#### Can I downgrade to an Individual selling plan if I’m in the Professional
selling plan?

Yes, you can choose to downgrade anytime from a Professional selling plan to
an Individual selling plan. Downgrading from a Professional selling plan to an
Individual selling plan may result in a change in your payment cycle. Please
