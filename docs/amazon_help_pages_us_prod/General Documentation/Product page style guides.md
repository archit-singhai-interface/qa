At Amazon, we do our best to provide a consistent look and feel for our
customers in terms of product display. However, each category has slightly
different requirements.

To help you create compelling and accurate detail pages, we have created
category style guides, which contain guidelines for images, descriptions, and
so on. We used PDF format for your ease of downloading and printing.

**Note:** Review the [Amazon Services Quick Start Style
Guide](https://m.media-
amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/help/Selling_on_Amazon_Quick_Start_Style_Guide_2018.pdf)
to learn the basic style guidelines that apply to all categories. Categories
can also have style requirements in addition to this Quick Start Style Guide,
so review any guides that specifically apply to the categories in which you
sell.

Download the style guide for your category from the style guide and BTG table
on the [Inventory file templates, style guides, and browse tree guides
(BTG)](/gp/help/1641) page.
