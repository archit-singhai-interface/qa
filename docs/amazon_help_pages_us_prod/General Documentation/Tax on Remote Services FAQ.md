#### What are remote services and when are they subject to tax?

Many jurisdictions have enacted “remote services” tax rules, which require
non-resident service providers (like Amazon) to charge, collect, and remit
value added taxes (“VAT”) which includes VAT, GST, consumption tax, and other
similar transaction taxes from their customers (like Selling Partners on
Amazon online stores). In most countries, the services in scope for taxation
are referred to as “Electronically Supplied Services” (“ESS”), although the
scope varies by country and in some cases includes almost all services
provided by a remote supplier.

ESS is generally defined as any service which are classified as following:  

  1. Delivered over the internet
  2. Essentially automated and involves minimal human intervention
  3. Would be impossible to provide without information technology

#### When does Amazon charge tax on remote services?

In most jurisdictions, listing fees, such as Selling on Amazon (“SoA”), and
advertising fees, such as Amazon Sponsored Advertising (“advertising”) fall
within the definition of remote services and ESS tax rules. Fulfillment by
Amazon (“FBA”) and related fees generally fall outside of the scope of such
rules.

If the following conditions are true, then Amazon may be required to charge
you VAT on your SoA and advertising fees:

  

  1. You purchase services from an Amazon store outside of the jurisdiction in which your business is located 
     * Example: Your business is located in Germany and you purchase SoA to make sales on Amazon.com
  2. The jurisdiction in which your business is located taxes the remote sale of services

Most jurisdictions that tax remote services do not require non-resident
service providers to charge VAT to business customers. To support this
treatment, the recipient of the service typically must provide its VAT or Tax
ID to the service provider.

The chart below shows jurisdictions where Amazon charges tax on the remote
sale of services as required under local law. It also shows whether the
provision of a VAT or Tax ID impacts taxability. Note that tax rules can
change frequently and the information below may become outdated. This
information is provided for reference only and should not be relied upon. If
you have questions, consult with your Tax Adviser.

#### How does Amazon determine my location?

Amazon uses the details you provide in your Seller Central account to
determine the location of you and/or your business. Relevant account details
include, but are not limited to:

  * [Business Address](/sw/AccountInfo/BusinessAddress/step/BusinessAddress)
  * [VAT registration number(s)](/hz/account-info/vat-information)
  * [Default Shipping Address](/sbr#settings) and [Return Address Settings](/returns/settings?ref_=macs_grtnaddr_cont_acinfohm)
  * [Banking information](/sw/AccountInfo/DepositMethodView/step/DepositMethodView?ref_=macs_aidepvw_cont_acinfohm)
  * [Credit card information ](/sw/AccountInfo/ChargeMethod/step/View?ref_=macs_aichrgvw_cont_acinfohm)

To ensure that you are taxed correctly, you must keep your account details
accurate and up to date. Failure to do so may result in incorrect tax
calculations and additional costs to you or your business.

Account information mentioned above can be updated by navigating to **Settings
> Account Info**.

#### What is my business address?

The address you provide as your [Business
Address](/sw/AccountInfo/BusinessAddress/step/BusinessAddress) must represent
your primary place of business where you receive services from Amazon.
Typically, your business address is where you have registered your business
and where its management is located. For non-business sellers, this represents
your usual place of residence.

Amazon may perform identity checks to confirm your business belongs at and
operates from this address.

#### What VAT information do I need to provide to ensure I am properly taxed?

At a minimum, you should provide your Tax ID or [VAT registration
number](/hz/account-info/vat-information) issued in the same country as your
business address. Failure to provide this Tax ID or VAT registration number
may result in incorrect tax charges.

Note: You may also provide other VAT registration numbers belonging to your
business in countries outside of your business address country.

#### What are my default shipping address and return address?

The [default shipping address](/sbr#settings) you provide must represent the
main address from which you self-fulfill orders. Note that this address may be
used by Amazon to determine the originating jurisdiction for your sales.

Your [return address](/returns/settings?ref_=macs_grtnaddr_cont_acinfohm) is
the main address you use to accept returns from your customers.

#### Will Amazon provide me with an invoice for tax collected on my fees?

Invoicing requirements for taxable sales of remote services vary by
jurisdiction. Amazon will supply an invoice when legally required to do so.

#### Where can I find invoices in my Seller Central Account?

To view tax invoices, go to **Seller Central > Reports > Tax Document Library
> Seller Fee Tax Invoices**.

#### I did not receive an invoice for my purchase of services. Where can I
find the amount of tax I was charged?

Regardless of whether Amazon issues an invoice or not, you may review VAT
charges in date range reports. You can view these reports by going to **Seller
Central > Reports > Payments > Date Range Reports >** and selecting a
transactional report for a particular time frame.

#### I don’t have a Tax ID or VAT ID, how do I get one?

The process of obtaining a Tax ID or VAT ID varies by jurisdiction. For more
information, consult the relevant tax authority website or your Tax Adviser.
If your country does not have VAT, or does not tax remote services, you may
still provide your VAT or other Tax ID in your Seller Central account.

#### How do I receive a refund for incorrectly charged tax on my fees?

As described above, Amazon calculates VAT on your fees based on the business
information you have supplied.

If you believe you were incorrectly charged, you may request a refund for
previously-charged VAT.

To inquire if a refund is available:  

  1. Contact [Amazon Selling Partner Support](/cu/contact-us) through the Contact Us form.   

    1. Choose **Selling on Amazon**
    2. Click **Other issues** and then **Tax Questions**
    3. Under **What are your tax questions,** request a refund of the incorrectly charged tax.
  2. You will receive an update for your case when your request has been processed. The update will provide the estimated date when you can expect to receive a refund in your seller account if your request was approved.

#### Can Amazon help me with my tax return?

While Amazon is committed to helping our sellers, we do not provide tax
advisory or compliance services. Contact your Tax Adviser if you have any
questions about taxes or need assistance with your tax returns. Amazon
maintains a [list of third-party tax advisors](/solution-
providers/#/search/US/tax?localeSelection=en_US) as a resource for sellers.
Amazon does not endorse the services of any tax advisor.
