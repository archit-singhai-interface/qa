As of June 1, 2024, a returns processing fee will go into effect for all
products (except apparel and shoes) with a high return rate by category, to
address the operational costs of returns and to reduce waste. The fee will
only apply to products that have return rates above a threshold specific to
each product’s fee category. The fee applied per unit is based on the
product’s size tier and shipping weight, as per the rates shared below.

Your product’s return rate will be the percent of your product’s shipped units
in a given month that’s returned by customers over that month and the
subsequent two calendar months. For a given month’s shipped units, the returns
processing fee will be charged for each returned unit above the product
category’s return rate threshold. For a particular month’s returns, the return
processing fee charge will be made between the 7th to 15th day of the third
subsequent month.

The return rate thresholds for each category are published below. You can also
view the return rate thresholds and your product’s return rate on [FBA
Returns](fba/returns/).

Your product is exempt from this fee if it shipped fewer than 25 units in a
month. If you are enrolled in the FBA New Selection program, we’ll waive the
returns processing fee for up to 20 units of each eligible parent ASIN.
Returned products must be received at a fulfillment center within 180 days of
the first inventory-received date. Go to [FBA New
Selection](/help/hub/reference/GWHQRT98SAZC29VQ) for more information and to
enroll.

For [Apparel and Shoes](/gc/fee-category-guidelines) products, a returns
processing fee is applied for each customer-returned unit. No thresholds are
applied and fees are charged as returns are made.

For more details, go to [2024 returns processing fee
changes](/help/hub/reference/GZGEQLTM3RZXUV6T).

**Example of returns processing fee**

1,000 units of a product were shipped to customers in June. In June, July, and
August, 120 of the 1,000 units shipped were returned. The returns threshold
for this example product category is 10%*. As a result, returns that exceed
100 units (10% of the 1,000 shipped) during the shipment month and subsequent
two months will incur returns processing fee. In this case 120 units were
returned, so 20 units would be charged the returns processing fee. The fee
will be charged between September 7 to 15.

_*Note that this return rate threshold is an illustrative example. The
thresholds for each category are published in the table below._

## Values used to calculate fee

**Product size tier** | Product size tiers are measurement categories based on the unit weight, product dimensions, and dimensional weight of a packaged item. Learn how to [determine your product-size tier](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W), or use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/reportcentral/STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES/1) to see the size tier information for products you have previously stored in FBA.  
---|---  
**Shipping weight** | The shipping weight is calculated based on the item’s unit weight or dimensional weight. Learn how to [determine your product's shipping weight](/gp/help/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY).  
**Return rate (all products excluding apparel and shoes)** | Your product’s return rate is the percentage of your product’s shipped units in a given month that are returned over that month and the following two calendar months. Find out your product’s return rate on [FBA Returns](/fba/returns/).  
**Return rate threshold (all products excluding apparel and shoes)** | This is the minimum return rate specific to each product’s fee category, above which your product will incur a return fee.   
  
**Return rate threshold (applicable to all products except apparel and shoes
category)**

Refer below for return rate thresholds per category.

**Note:** We audit fee categories periodically and update them. The return
rate threshold applied to the high return rate fee for a particular month is
based on your product's fee category at the end of the three calendar months
measurement period.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I know if I will get charged the returns processing fee for non-
apparel and non-shoes items?

Effective May 1, 2024, you can review your product’s return rate on the [FBA
Returns](/fba/returns/) page, which is updated three times a week. This allows
you to monitor your returns and return rates for a given month’s shipped
units.

You can also view your historic return rates for a particular product to
assess if your return rate has been above or below the threshold and take
corrective actions to bring down your product’s return rates.

#### Where can I see the charge details for the returns processing fee for
non-apparel and non-shoes items?

For a particular month’s returns, you will see return processing fee charged
to your account between the 7th to 15th day of the third subsequent month. For
example, for units shipped in June that are returned and are subject to the
fee, the fee will be charged between September 7 to 15.

You can see the return processing fees charged per ASIN in the Manage Your
Payments tool. You can also download a report from the Amazon Fulfillment
Reports section of Seller Central to see a detailed breakdown of the number of
shipped units, returned units, returned units that exceeded the threshold, and
units charged. You can view your return fee at the SKU level in the SKU
Economics tool.
