Keep your listings discoverable

To prevent your listing from becoming search suppressed, Amazon may require
you to take action before a certain date. If you do not take action, such by
adding the required attributes, your ASIN may be removed from search.

To view listings that are at risk of being removed from search, go to the
**Inventory** menu and select **Manage all Inventory**. To see the reasons
your listings are at risk, you can filter Listing Status for Search
Suppressed. For each SKU, you can click the issue to display on the same page
via the right side panel why your listings area at risk and what actions you
can take to address issues.

Alternately, you can click **Search Suppressed and Inactive Listings** in the
**Listing Tools** column to launch a new tab. Here, on the [Fix Your
Products](/fixyourproducts?ref_=myi_ia_vl_fba) page, from the left panel,
click **At Risk Listing**. The table displays reasons why your listings are at
risk and what action you can take. After you address the individual reasons,
click **Save**. Changes will take up to 48 hours to reflect.
