The FBA Donations program makes it possible for you to automatically donate
your unwanted inventory to select US nonprofits.

## How it works

When you request donation/disposal of eligible overstock, returned, or other
unwanted FBA inventory in US fulfillment centers, Amazon makes it available to
select US nonprofits.

Our usual [donation/disposal fees](/gp/help/G5FKTA8LXU4TZPD5) apply.

The FBA Donations program is available only for inventory stored in US
fulfillment centers.

## Eligible products

The eligibility of an ASIN for donation is subject to legal, safety, and
regulatory guidelines, in addition to nonprofit location, interest, and need.

If a product isn't eligible for donation, Amazon will dispose of it in
accordance with relevant regulations and safety guidelines.

Products that aren't eligible for donation include the following:

  * Dangerous goods (some types of hazmat) 
  * Prohibited and restricted products 
  * Recalled products 
  * Products with internal memory 
  * Counterfeit products 
  * Products with safety concerns 
  * Any other products that may be defective or inappropriate for donation

## US program partner

FBA Donations partners with [Good360](https://good360.org) to distribute
donated FBA inventory across its diverse network of US nonprofits, which
support people in need. As part of their agreement with Good360, the
nonprofits may not sell, trade, or barter donated goods.

The following table provides more information on Good360:

##  How to opt out

You’re enrolled in FBA Donations by default. When you’re enrolled in the
program, we’ll evaluate all of your eligible product disposals for donation.

To verify your enrollment status, select **Fulfillment by Amazon** from the
**Settings** drop-down menu, and scroll down to **FBA Donations program**. To
opt out, click **Edit** , and then select **Disable**.

Donations/disposals that are made after you opt out will no longer be eligible
for the program.

##  Donations reporting

Receipts for donations made in the previous year will be available on your
[Donation Certificates](/donation/donationCertificates) page.

The Donations Certificate will be generated on a yearly basis, and will
provide a list of the inventory that was donated through FBA Donations in the
previous year. The certificate will be available by February 1.

Donations Certificates are issued by Good360 on behalf of the recipient
charities, and Good360 and the recipient charities are responsible for its
content.

Receipts for donations are generated based on your business information in
Seller Central. Make sure that your business information is accurate by
verifying or updating it on the [Business
address](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/sw/AccountInfo/BusinessAddress/step/BusinessAddress?ref_=macs_aibusadd_cont_acinfohm)
page.

**Note:** We won’t be able to reissue donation receipts that were generated
based on inaccurate business information.

## Tax considerations

Amazon cannot provide tax advice to sellers who take part in FBA Donations.
Contact your tax adviser to discuss the program and to determine whether a
charitable deduction is an option for you.
