Amazon customers find products through search and browse. When customers
browse, they can further refine their search by choosing specific product
categories and subcategories. Classify your products so that they also appear
in browse.

**Note:** If your product is created in the wrong category, see [Change a
productâ€™s category](/gp/help/G201950630).

For large product volumes, use a Browse Tree Guide (BTG) to help you identify
the correct categories for your products. BTGs provide unique numbers and
keywords that are associated with a certain browse path on Amazon.

**Note:** For small volumes, use [Add Products via Upload](/listing/download)
(Product Classifier) to categorize up to approximately 20-30 product types, or
[Select a product
category](/productclassify/index.html?query=&ref_=xx_pclasshm_cont_prodsrch)
to classify products one-by-one.

To use a BTG:  

  1. Go to [Inventory File Templates and BTG](/gp/help/1641) and download the appropriate BTG from the relevant link in the table.
  2. Follow the instructions in the guide and choose the categories and subcategories for your products. Use the corresponding browse node IDs when you upload your inventory template file.
