The Customer Service by Amazon (CSBA) fee is charged on each seller-fulfilled
shipped unit according to your customer service performance, which is measured
by **Contacts per Unit (CPU)**. CPU is the number of order related customer
inquiries (for example, calls, instant messages, and emails) that Amazon
handled on your behalf per total seller-fulfilled shipped units. For example,
if Amazon handled 40 customer inquiries on your behalf in the previous three
months in which you shipped 1,000 seller-fulfilled units, your CPU for the
period would be 4% (40/1,000).

Table 1. CSBA rate card Fee tier | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  
---|---|---|---|---  
CPU range | <=5% | >5% & <=15% | >15% & <=30% | >30%  
Fee rate (per seller-fulfilled shipped unit) | $0.10 | $0.25 | $0.50 | $0.70  
  
Your fee tier will be calculated based on your previous three-month’s CPU. For
example, if your CPU from the previous three-months is 4%, your fee rate for
this quarter would be $0.10 per seller-fulfilled shipped unit. We will charge
you a standard fee rate of $0.25 per seller-fulfilled unit in some cases when
your CPU performance is unknown or unreliable (for example, CPU >15% but 30 or
fewer seller-fulfilled units shipped in the previous three months). We will
communicate your fee tier on the first day of every month. Your CSBA fee rate
will reduce as you improve your customer service performance by reducing your
customer contacts.

**Note:** The CSBA fee will be charged per seller-fulfilled shipped unit
regardless of the customer contact volume. Your Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) or
Seller Fulfilled Prime units will not be charged as part of CSBA.

Table 2. Fee rate calculation examples: Example | 1 | 2 | 3  
---|---|---|---  
**Previous three months** | **Customer inquiries (contacts) handled by CSBA** | 40 | 40 | 200  
**seller-fulfilled units shipped by the seller** | 1000 | 400 | 1000  
**CPU (contacts/seller-fulfilled units)** | 4% | 10% | 20%  
**CPU range** | 0-5% | 5-15% | 15-30%  
**Next three months** | **Fee tier** | **1** | **2** | **3**  
**Fee rate ($ per seller-fulfilled unit)** | **$0.10** | **$0.25** | **$0.50**  
**seller-fulfilled units shipped by the seller** | 500 | 500 | 500  
**Total CSBA charge (fee rate * seller-fulfilled units)** | **$50** | **$125** | **$250**

## Frequently asked questions

#### How will I know my fee rate?

You can see your CSBA fee charge by going to the [Payments
Dashboard](/payments/dashboard/index.html?_encoding=UTF8&ref_=xx_payments_dnav_xx).
We will also communicate your quarterly fee rate on the first day of every
month through an email along with the customer inquiry details. We will also
communicate your promotions eligibility status and discounted fee rates (if
applicable) along with monthly fee email.

**Important:** The CSBA fee rate will be updated quarterly based on your
previous three-month’s CPU, which is the number of order related customer
inquiries that Amazon handles on your behalf per seller-fulfilled shipped
unit.

#### When is the CSBA fee charged?

Similar to referral fees, the CSBA fee is charged when you ship a seller-
fulfilled unit. Your fee rate for the quarter will be decided on the first day
of every quarter. We will charge the fee rate on each seller-fulfilled unit
shipped in that particular quarter. For example, if your fee rate for January
to March is $0.10, then we will charge you $0.10 on each seller-fulfilled unit
you ship in during January to March.

**Note:** You will receive 90-day free service to try CSBA after joining for
the first time. The CSBA fee will be charged automatically after your 90-day
free trial expires.

#### What is Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)?

Valid Tracking Rate (VTR) is defined as all packages with a valid tracking
number as a percentage of total packages during a given 30-day time period.
VTR only applies to seller-fulfilled orders. For more information, refer to
[VTR policy page](/gp/help/G201817070).

#### How will you determine promotions eligibility?

We will determine your promotions eligibility every quarter based on your
Valid Tracking Rate (VTR) performance in the previous quarter. If eligible,
you will either receive CSBA service for free or at discounted rates based on
your CPU. If you do not meet the requirements, you will be charged according
to your regular quarterly fee rate.

#### What will be my fee rate if I am a new seller or I joined CSBA in the
middle of the quarter?

You will receive a 90-day free trial after joining CSBA for the first time.
Post your free trial, we will calculate your fee rate based on your available
CPU in the previous quarter. In some cases when your CPU performance is
unknown or unreliable (for example, CPU >15% but 30 or fewer units in the
previous quarter), we will charge you as per the standard fee rate of $0.25
per seller-fulfilled unit, until we have enough information to decide your fee
tier.

#### What is Contacts per Unit (CPU)?

Contacts per Unit (CPU) is a way to measure your customer service performance.
CPU is the number of contacts that are order related customer inquiries (for
example, calls, instant messages, and emails) that Amazon handles on your
behalf per seller-fulfilled shipped unit. CPU calculation only includes order
related customer inquiries handled by the CSBA team. It does not include FBA
or SFP order related queries handled by Amazon or pre-order customer inquiries
handled by you through the [Buyer-Seller Messaging Service](/messaging/inbox).
We take the previous quarter CPU data to decide your quarterly fee tier as it
improves CPU stability and reduces abrupt fee changes due to short-term
customer service performance variations.

#### Can I reduce my fee rate?

Yes. You can reduce your fee rate by improving your CPU. CPU is a measure of
customer service performance. As you perform better, your CPU will improve and
your fee rate will be lowered. Here are some tips to help you improve your
CPU:

Delivery experience

  * Provide valid tracking information to your order after shipment.
  * Select a carrier that provides end-to-end tracking information.
  * Set achievable shipping and delivery dates for your orders.
  * Ship the orders on time.

Return, Refund, and Cancelation

  * Show clear return and refund policies on the policy page.
  * Provide an accurate return shipping address.
  * If you can provide a better return and refund policy than Amazon’s standard policy, share it on your policy page.
  * Provide accurate stock volume information to avoid pre-fulfillment cancelation.

Product details

  * Provide accurate product information (for example, product color and size) and regularly update the product detail page.
  * Regularly update the frequently asked questions (FAQ) on the product detail page.
  * Improve packaging and product quality.
