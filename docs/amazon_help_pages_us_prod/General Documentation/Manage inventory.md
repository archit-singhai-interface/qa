The [Manage Inventory](/inventory) gives you access to the most important
Seller Central features.

To access the **Manage Inventory** , go to Seller Central and select **Manage
All Inventory** on the Inventory tab.

  * On the **Manage Inventory** , you can search, view, and update listings. 
  * You can find specific listing information by searching terms such as SKU, product name, and ASIN.

each listing information.
