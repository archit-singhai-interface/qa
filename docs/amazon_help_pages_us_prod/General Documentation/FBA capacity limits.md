FBA capacity limits help us manage unexpected surges in demand and supply
chain disruptions so that we can run our fulfillment network efficiently and
get your products to customers faster.

FBA capacity limits also give you clarity about your future access to FBA
capacity so that you can plan how much inventory to procure and manufacture,
and when to design and launch new products in Amazon’s store.

## View your capacity limits

You can view your capacity limits and capacity usage in the **Capacity
Monitor** at the bottom of the [FBA dashboard](/fba/dashboard).

Use the tabs to select a storage type. The chart on the left displays your
current capacity usage by inventory status and your remaining capacity for
creating new shipments. The table on the right displays your estimated
capacity limits for the next three months.

## How capacity limits are set

You’ll receive one capacity limit for each storage type per month.

  * **Individual selling accounts** have a capacity limit of 15 cubic feet; this limit doesn’t change and is not eligible to be increased. 
  * **New professional selling accounts (active in FBA for less than 39 weeks)** don’t receive FBA capacity limits. This allows you to establish your FBA sales record without limits so that we can determine how much capacity your FBA business needs as you grow. 
  * **Professional selling accounts (active in FBA for more than 39 weeks)** receive capacity limits based on IPI score and sales performance. Sellers with consistently higher IPI scores receive higher capacity limits, adjusted for sales volume and available capacity. Usage against your FBA capacity limits will consider your inventory on-hand at Amazon and open shipments on the way to our fulfillment centers, calculated in cubic feet.

Capacity limits are typically announced during the fourth week of the month.
You can view updates via the Capacity Monitor and will also receive an email
notification. We’ll confirm your limit for the upcoming month, reaffirm or
adjust your estimated limit for the following month, and estimate your limit
for the month after that.

For example, on April 24, 2024, we’ll confirm your capacity limit for May 1
through 31, reaffirm or adjust your limit for June 1 through 30, and estimate
your limit for July 1 through 31. Estimated capacity limits might increase if
your sales and inventory performance exceed our forecast, or decrease if
there’s greater demand for capacity than expected. Any changes to estimated
capacity limits will be reported in the Capacity Monitor.

Your capacity limit is influenced by your IPI score, as well as other factors
such as historical sales volume, seasonal and peak selling periods for your
products, forecasts for your ASINs, the new selection that you carry, deals
that you’ve scheduled, fulfillment center capacity, and shipment lead time.

## Capacity Manager

If you’d like more capacity for products that you’re confident customers will
buy, you can use [Capacity Manager](/inventory-storage/storage-request/limit-
increase) to request an increase to your capacity limits at a reservation fee
that you specify.

Here’s how it works:

  1. **Tell us how much additional capacity you want, and when**. Limit increases can be requested in monthly increments for any future period in which you have a capacity limit or estimated capacity limit. The maximum amount that you may request in a given storage type and period will vary based on available capacity in our networks.

  2. **Set the maximum reservation fee that you’re willing to pay for the extra capacity, if it’s available**. The fee can be offset with performance credits earned from sales generated using the additional space. No upfront payment is required.

**Important:** The reservation fee that you set should reflect your confidence
in your ability to sell the inventory and offset the reservation fee with
performance credits. If you’re not confident that you can sell the inventory
and offset the fee, we recommend that you don’t request the capacity as you’ll
be responsible for the remaining balance (your reservation fee minus
performance credits).

  3. **We’ll assess fulfillment center capacity regularly (typically twice per week) and grant requests as capacity is available**. We grant requests with the highest reservation fee per cubic foot first and continue in this order until all available capacity has been allocated. If your request is granted, the capacity will be available to you for the entire period that you specified.

  4. **If your request is granted, your capacity limit will increase in the Capacity Monitor**. When the specified period starts, you’ll earn a $0.15 performance credit for every dollar of sales that you generate using additional capacity. We designed this credit to give you the opportunity to offset 100% of the reservation fee, if you sell the inventory. 

**Important:** Your total capacity is the sum of the capacity limit that you
receive from Amazon (“estimated capacity limit”) plus any additional capacity
that you request and receive via Capacity Manager. If your capacity limit
increase request was granted, and we later reduce your estimated capacity
limits, the portion of capacity that you received through Capacity Manager
won’t change. If your estimated capacity limits increase, we’ll reduce the
additional capacity requested by the amount of the estimated capacity limit
increase (so your total reserved capacity is unchanged) or cancel your request
if the increase is greater than your request.

For more information, go to [Capacity Manager](/gp/help/GM6SJGQDA625AUCJ).

## Exceeding your capacity limit

If your on-hand inventory plus shipments on the way to our fulfillment centers
exceeds your capacity limit, you’ll be blocked from creating new shipments to
Amazon. You’ll also be blocked if you are below your capacity limit, but the
quantity of units that you’re attempting to ship would result in exceeding
your limit.

## Mapping between storage types and product size tiers

The table below helps you understand the mapping of product dimensions and
weight to storage types and product size tiers. All the dimensions are
combined with an 'OR' statement. This means that if any (dimension) condition
is true then the item will fall in that category.

Storage type | Length (in) | Width (in) | Height (in) | Weight (lb) / Shipping weight* | Length + Girth (in) | Product size tier  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Standard-size | ≤ 15 | ≤ 12  | ≤ 0.75 | ≤ 16 oz | N/A | Small standard-size  
≤ 18 | ≤ 14  | ≤ 8 | ≤ 20 | N/A | Large standard-size**  
Oversize | > Standard-size and not extra-large | > Standard-size and not extra-large | > Standard-size and not extra-large | > Standard-size and not extra-large | N/A | Oversize  
≤ 59 | ≤ 33 | ≤ 33 | ≤ 50 | ≤ 130 | Large bulky**  
Extra-large | 70 ≤ 96 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Extra-large  
> 96 | ≥ 8.5 | ≥ 8.5 | ≥ 50 | N/A | Extra-large 0 to 50 lb**  
> 59 | > 33 | > 33 | 50 ≤ 70 | > 130 | Extra-large 50 to 70 lb**  
> 59 | > 33 | > 33 | 70 ≤ 150 | > 130 | Extra-large 70 to 150 lb**  
> 59 | > 33 | > 33 | > 150 | > 130 | Extra-large more than 150 lb**  
  
**Note:**

  * *If the product’s unit weight or dimensional weight greater than 50 lb, it is also Extra-large 
  * *Shipping weight is the greater of unit weight or dimensional weight for determining size tiers
  * **For large standard, oversize (excluding special oversize), large bulky, and extra-large (excluding more than 150 lb), Amazon uses dimensional weight when it’s greater than the unit weight to calculate fees. Fees for small standard, special oversize, and extra-large more than 150 lb are calculated using only unit weight.

## Frequently asked questions

#### What are storage types?

FBA capacity limits and capacity usage are determined by storage type:
standard-size, oversize, apparel, footwear, or extra-large. Amazon classifies
each product into exactly one storage type, based on their weight and
dimension. You can’t adjust the storage type.

To view your products’ storage type and volume, go to [FBA
Inventory](/inventoryplanning/manageinventoryhealth).

Capacity limits for dangerous goods (flammable and aerosol) are handled
separately. For more information, go to [FBA Dangerous Goods
program](/gp/help/GZLZBQ7W6QZRKWWK).

#### How do I calculate cubic feet?

  

  1. Multiply length x width x height in inches to get the volume.
  2. Divide the volume by 1,728, which is 12 cubic inches.

**Example** : A unit measuring 47 x 12 x 10 inches divided by 1,728 = 3.3
cubic feet.

**Note:** We may verify product weight and dimensions using representative
samples from your inventory. If our weight and dimension information differs
from yours, our information will be used to calculate fees. Fees and inventory
usage are calculated using the latest information that’s available to us.

#### Can I exchange capacity in one storage type for capacity in another
storage type?

No. Capacity can’t be exchanged between storage types.

#### How do my Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) orders affect my capacity
limits?

MCF orders are included in your past and forecasted sales data, which is used
to calculate your capacity limits. You can see capacity from your MCF sales in
the Capacity Monitor.

#### How can I better manage my inventory with capacity limits?

To maximize the capacity available within your limits, we recommend that you
take the following actions:

  * **Cancel open shipments that you don’t intend to send** Open shipments count towards your total capacity usage, so close them if you no longer plan to send in those items. To view and cancel a shipment, go to [Shipping Queue](/gp/ssof/shipping-queue.html). Click the shipment name and then **View shipment** or **Track shipment** to see the shipment details. Then click **Cancel shipment** or **Delete shipment**.
  * **Improve sell-through of your FBA inventory** When you increase your sell-through rate you can free up space for new products. We offer recommendations to increase sales on the [FBA Inventory](/inventoryplanning/manageinventoryhealth) page, such as markdowns, outlet deals, advertisements, or updates to product pages. 
  * **Use Multi-Channel Fulfillment to sell your inventory on other sales channels**. Multi-Channel Fulfillment lets you use Amazon’s network to fulfill orders from non-Amazon sources, such as your own website. For more information, go to [Multi-Channel Fulfillment](/gp/help/200332450). 
  * **Remove inventory** Create a removal order to reduce the amount of inventory that’s stored in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. To create a removal order, go to [FBA Inventory](/inventoryplanning/manageinventoryhealth?ref=fbacentral_nav_fba), select the items that you’d like to remove, and click **Create removal order** from the bulk action drop-down menu. When you create a removal order, you can take advantage of Amazon’s value recovery options like liquidations or donations. You can also have items returned directly to you. Additionally, you can set up automatic removals for aging items or unsellable units. To adjust these options, go to settings, then select **Fulfillment by Amazon**. Scroll down to **Automated unfulfillable settings** and **Automated fulfillable inventory settings**. Use these options to choose how items are sent back to you and to help you keep your inventory fresh for customers and balance your capacity limits.

**Important:** Removal orders will be reflected in your capacity usage within
24 hours of the order being created, even if the order is still in **Pending**
status. Customer returns will be added back into your capacity usage when the
returns are received.

  * **Follow restock recommendations** Make sure you don’t send more inventory than suggested by following the restock recommendations on the [Restock Inventory](/restockinventory/recommendations) page.

#### Do you account for seasonality when setting capacity limits?

Yes, we factor in forecasts of your seasonal sales patterns along with your
IPI score and other details such as historical sales volume, the new selection
that you carry, deals that you’ve scheduled, fulfillment center capacity, and
shipment lead time.

You can also request additional capacity via [Capacity Manager](/inventory-
storage/storage-request/limit-increase) for periods that you expect higher
sales.
