Understanding return shipping costs is crucial for effectively managing your
Amazon seller-fulfilled orders.

## Responsibility for return shipping

The responsibility for return shipping costs depends on the reason for the
return:

  * **Seller-at-fault returns** : You are responsible for return shipping costs, for example, if you send an incorrect or damaged product to the buyer. In these cases, you must provide a full refund to the buyer, including the original shipping cost. 
  * **Buyer-at-fault returns** : You can deduct return shipping costs from the refund. This applies to situations such as accidental orders or when the buyer finds a better price elsewhere. 

To determine who is at fault for a return, go to [Return reason codes for
prepaid returns](/gp/help/202080050).

## Amazon prepaid return labels

For returns using Amazon prepaid labels, return shipping costs are charged
automatically to the buyer or seller depending on the return reason that the
buyer selected.

## Free returns

In certain situations, you may be required to offer free returns:

  * If you opt to offer free returns for a specific ASIN or SKU, you’ll be charged for return shipping regardless of the reason code. 
  * Amazon requires free returns for soft-line category items, such as fashion items. For more information, go to [Free returns on fashion items for seller-fulfilled orders](/gp/help/GEKBRFKQE38CQA6V).

## International returns

You are responsible for return shipping costs, even for returns where the
buyer is at fault.

If damaged or materially different items were delivered to the buyer, you must
also refund the cost of the original shipping. If you offer a domestic return
option, you aren’t required to refund the cost of the original shipping.

For more information, go to [Customer returns for international
sales](/help/hub/reference/G201468550).
