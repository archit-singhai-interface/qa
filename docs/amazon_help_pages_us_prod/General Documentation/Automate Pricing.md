Automate Pricing allows you to automatically adjust prices on SKUs in your
catalog in response to events such as the Featured Offer (Buy Box) price,
without having to revisit the SKU every time you want to change your price.

Learn how to use the Automate Pricing feature

You create a pricing rule, set the rule parameters, and then select the SKUs
to which the rule applies. This is because automated pricing is applied only
to the SKUs you designate, not to your entire catalog. You can start and stop
automated pricing rules at any time, as well as change your rules or the SKUs
to which your rules apply. You control the prices by defining rule parameters,
setting minimum price and maximum price (optional) boundaries, and selecting
the SKUs on which to automate pricing.If you do not set a maximum price,
Automate Pricing will protect customer trust on your behalf by ensuring that
your offers are not priced significantly higher than recent prices so that
your offers remain eligible to become the Featured Offer.

You can manage your SKUs either with the [Automate Pricing
tool](/automatepricing/home), or using the Automate Pricing file.

If you set your listings to Inactive, any pricing rules that apply to those
listings are paused until your listings are set to Active again. For more
information on how to set your listings to Active or Inactive, go to [listing
status for vacations, holidays, and other absences](/gp/help/200135620).

Amazon Business sellers: Automate Pricing can also be used to automatically
