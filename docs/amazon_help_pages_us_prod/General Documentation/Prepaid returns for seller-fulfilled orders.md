We provide buyers with prepaid return shipping labels on your behalf through
Buy Shipping services. US sellers are automatically enrolled in the prepaid
return program per [our returns
policies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=15015721).
In the table below are guidelines for the items covered under the program.

Account requirements  |  Make sure that you keep your account up to date.   

  1. Set up a default return address. You’re required to provide a US domestic address for the prepaid return label program. We’ll use this address for all prepaid returns. To learn more, go to [Return address settings](/gp/help/G201711720). **Note:** You must provide a valid return shipping address. If returns can’t be delivered due to an outdated or incorrect return address that you provided, the returned items will be deemed abandoned, and we may dispose of them as appropriate and retain any proceeds. The continued use of an outdated or incorrect address may result in you no longer being able to sell on Amazon. To learn more, go to [Returns, refunds, cancellations, and claims](/gp/help/G69126).
  2. Maintain accurate weight and size information for products that you sell, and update as needed. We calculate return shipping costs based on this information. We’ll charge your seller account for the cost of the return shipping once the buyer sends the product back. For more information, go to [Shipping costs for seller-fulfilled returns](/gp/help/G202103400). **Note:** If you’ve opted into free returns or sell fashion items, you won’t be able to deduct the return shipping cost for in-policy returns. To learn more, go to [Free returns for seller-fulfilled orders](/gp/help/G8EKQAPUCQA9RAP8) and [Free returns on fashion items for seller-fulfilled returns](/help/hub/reference/GEKBRFKQE38CQA6V).

  
Return process | You’ll get an email notification each time a buyer requests a return and receives a prepaid return shipping label. The [Manage Returns tool](/gp/returns/list/ref=ag_xx_cont_200708210) displays all returns. For more information, go to [Manage seller-fulfilled returns](/gp/help/G200708210).  
Multiple return addresses | You can set up multiple US return addresses. For details, go to [Multiple return addresses](/gp/help/202183780).  
Returnless resolutions | Offer returnless resolutions by issuing a refund or replacement and letting the buyer keep the original product. If a buyer requests a return that is eligible for a returnless resolution, they’ll get either a full refund or the option to receive a replacement item once they submit their return request. You can find these return requests in [Manage Returns](/gp/returns/list/ref=ag_xx_cont_200708210). Returnless refunds don’t need to be processed manually. To learn more, go to [Returnless resolutions](/gp/help/G202174940).  
Return shipping |  UPS and USPS provide return shipping for seller-fulfilled orders through Buy Shipping services. For details, go to [Prepaid return shipping services](/gp/help/G202175020). **Important:** Buyers can also arrange to send the return product on their own. We’ll charge your account for the return label cost only when the buyer gives the package to the carrier.  
Refunds and cost of shipping |  To learn more about refund types, go to [Refund options](/help/hub/reference/G201725630) and [Refund return shipping cost](/gp/help/G202175040). To learn about how return shipping costs are calculated, go to [Shipping costs for seller-fulfilled returns](/gp/help/G202103400). For more information about return shipping for fashion items, go to [Free returns on fashion items for seller-fulfilled orders](/gp/help/GEKBRFKQE38CQA6V).  
Reports for prepaid returns |  All prepaid returns are recorded in your Settlement, Payments, and Return reports.

  * **Settlement and Payments reports** : Each return shipping charge will appear in your Settlement and Payments reports as shipping services purchased through Amazon. These costs will be separate from the order charges.
  * **Return reports** : You’ll get an email notification each time a buyer requests a return and receives a prepaid return shipping label. Additionally, your Return report shows all the return requests that you’ve received, including the status of each return. Both the email and the report will include order ID, tracking ID, return reason, label cost, date requested, return merchandise authorization ID, and comments.

  
Ineligible items | Prepaid return shipping labels aren’t always provided for automatically authorized returns. For details, go to [Ineligible items for prepaid returns](/gp/help/G202174960).  
Category exemptions |  Several categories and subcategories are automatically exempt from prepaid return labels. Exemption requests aren’t required for the following categories:

  * Handmade
  * Certified preowned watches
  * Non-physical items (for example, warranties, digital software, and digital coupons)
  * Items that are non-returnable by law and dangerous goods
  * Extra-large or heavy items

  
SKU exemptions |  You can request exemptions from prepaid return labels only for SKUs in the following categories:

  * High price items: High-value items (price exceeding $100) that need special shipping (for example, items that require special shipping insurance)

The price and condition of exempted SKUs must be comparable to listings for
the same ASIN across Amazon. Only active SKUs are eligible for exemptions from
prepaid return labels. To view the status of your SKUs, select **Inventory**
from the drop-down menu in Seller Central and then select **Manage
inventory**. **Important:** SKU exemptions for prepaid return labels do not
apply to Seller-Fulfilled Prime items. Seller-Fulfilled Prime in-policy
returns will receive an Amazon prepaid label. For details, go to [Seller-
Fulfilled Prime program policy](/gp/help/G201812300). **Note:** To learn how
to offer returnless resolutions for specific SKUs, go to [Returnless
resolutions for seller-fulfilled returns](/gp/help/G202174940).  
Appeal a refund |  You can file an appeal if we issued a refund on your behalf that you don’t believe should have been authorized. **For buyer-returned damaged items** : When creating your claim, provide pictures that link the return to the purchased product, such as images of the damaged item and of non-damaged original items. Additional supporting documentation may also include images of the shipping label, tracking ID, or proof of delivery. **Note:** Per our restocking fee policy, reimbursement for buyer-damaged items will be limited to a maximum of 50% of the order value of the item. For details, go to [Reimbursement for seller-fulfilled network prepaid returns](/gp/help/G202175000).  
  
## Printed return labels

Buyers can contact Amazon Customer Service, to have a physical label mailed to
them for a small fee.

## File a claim with the carrier

You are responsible for filing a claim directly with the carrier if a return
is lost or damaged in transit:

  * **UPS** : To file a claim for a lost or damaged item, call UPS Preferred Claims at 1-800-711-5914 and provide the agent with relevant details. Don’t file loss or damage claims via an alternative UPS phone number or the UPS website. 
  * **USPS** : File a claim for damage or loss through the USPS website or by mail. To learn more, go to the [USPS website](https://www.usps.com/help/claims.htm).
