FBA Liquidations is designed to help you recover value from excess and
customer-returned inventory, avoid storage fees, and prevent the disposal of
inventory.

## How it works

Instead of paying to remove or dispose of excess or customer-returned FBA
inventory, you can choose to use FBA Liquidations to have the inventory
liquidated through a liquidator. By liquidating inventory, you recover a
portion of your inventory cost (net recovery value) while avoiding monthly
storage fees and aged-inventory surcharges, formerly known as long-term
storage fees. The net recovery value should appear in your account within 90
days of submitting your order.

By participating in this program, you agree to the [FBA Liquidations program
terms and conditions](/gp/help/G201507460).

## How we calculate your net recovery value

Amazon determines the value of your inventory by evaluating several factors,
including:

  * [Your sales history](/gp/help/S3S7TP5FM7D5MEQ)
  * The average FBA selling price on Amazon
  * The sales history of the specific ASIN

Based on contracted rates, liquidators will purchase this inventory for a
gross recovery value, which is about 5% to 10% of the product’s value. Amazon
will then deduct fees and pay you the net recovery value.

## Fees

**Note:** Amazon charges FBA Liquidations fees which incur when shipments
leave fulfillment centers. If you submitted a liquidation order before June
24, 2021, these liquidation fees will apply if your inventory is shipped to a
liquidator on or after that date.

Amazon will apply two separate fees to each item you liquidate:

  * The **liquidations processing fee** is per item and based on item size and weight (see Table 1).
  * The **liquidations referral fee** is 15% and calculated on the gross recovery value.

**Note:** The liquidations referral fee structure above has been updated from
our prior announcement, which indicated that the fee would vary by item
category.

_Table 1: Processing fee_

| Item weight | Fee  
---|---|---  
[Standard-size items](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W) | 0–0.5 lb | $0.25  
0.5–1.0 lb | $0.30  
1–2.0 lb | $0.35  
over 2.0 lb | $0.40 + $0.20 per lb above first 2 lb  
[Oversize and special handling items*](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W) | 0–1.0 lb | $0.60  
1.0–2.0 lb | $0.70  
2.0–4.0 lb | $0.90  
4.0–10.0 lb | $1.45  
over 10.0 lb  | $1.90 + $0.20 per lb above first 10 lb  
  
_*Special handling items may include apparel, shoes, watches, jewelry, and
dangerous goods._

2 _You can continue to recover value yourself by having Amazon return your
inventory to you._

**Note:** Once eligible inventory is submitted with a liquidation order,
monthly storage fees and aged-inventory surcharges will cease to accrue for
that inventory.

##  Product eligibility

Eligibility is subject to legal, safety, and regulatory guidelines. Products
not eligible for liquidation include:

  * [Dangerous goods (hazmat)](/gp/help/201003400)
  * [Recalled inventory](/gp/help/G200164750)

Amazon liquidations are subject to various macroeconomic conditions, periodic
negotiations with buyers, and sales data. Demand for specific products may
fluctuate and if Amazon cannot find a buyer for your product(s) type, they may
be marked ineligible for FBA Liquidations. Additionally, ineligibility reason
may also indicate legal or policy restrictions. Examples of items currently
under these are:

  * Face Masks
  * Jewelry

**Note:** For unfulfillable inventory, only items with a reason of **Customer
Damaged** , **Carrier Damaged** , or **Distributor Damaged** are eligible for
liquidation. Items with a reason of **Expired** , **Defective** , and
**Warehouse Damaged** are not eligible for liquidation. For more information
on eligibility errors, go to the "Error messages with your order" section on
this page.

## Create a liquidation order

Submit inventory to be liquidated by creating a removal order. You can create
a removal order from an inventory planning page or the Recommended Removal
report:

  * [Manage Excess Inventory](/inventoryplanning/excess-inventory/ref=icpd_rp_w_g)
  * [Inventory Age](/inventoryplanning/inventory-age)
  * [Remove Unfulfillable Inventory](/myinventory/unfulfillable/index.html)
  * [Fix Stranded Inventory](/inventoryplanning/stranded-inventory)
  * [Manage Inventory](/inventory)
  * [Inventory Amazon Fulfills](/hz/inventory/view/FBAKNIGHTS)
  * [Recommended Removal report](/reportcentral/RECOMMENDED_REMOVAL/0)

To create a liquidation order, follow these steps:

  1. Open the **Create Removal Order** form.
     * From any inventory planning page, select one or more ASINs and then, from the **Action on selected** drop-down menu, choose **Create removal order**.
     * Or, from the [Recommended Removal report](/reportcentral/RECOMMENDED_REMOVAL/0), click **Begin removal process**.

**Note:** If this option does not appear, you do not have inventory that we
recommend you remove.

  2. Select **Liquidations** as your method of removal.

  3. Enter the amount of **fulfillable** or **unfulfillable quantity** to liquidate.

  4. Click **Review**. You'll be prompted to confirm your order.

**Important:** Once you confirm your liquidation order, it cannot be canceled.

  5. Click **Confirm**.

## Liquidate inventory automatically

You can set up automated liquidations removals for your inventory at
fulfillment centers. Automated liquidations removals are available for both
fulfillable and unfulfillable inventory.

For more information, including how to enable automated settings, go to
[Remove inventory automatically](/gp/help/G200678710).

## Track your liquidation orders

**Note:** Due to COVID-19, there may be delays in these estimated timelines.
However, monthly storage fees and aged-inventory surcharges will no longer
accrue upon liquidation order submission.

Estimated timeline | Track status  
---|---  
Day 0 | 

  * Liquidation order is submitted.
  * Monthly storage fees and aged-inventory surcharges stop accruing.

  
Days 0–30 | 

  * Inventory is reserved and displays as **In Process Qty** on the [Removal Order Detail report](/reportcentral/REMOVAL_ORDER_DETAIL/0). The order status shows as **Pending**. 

  
Day 30 (or before) | 

  * Inventory ships to one or more liquidators and is marked as **Completed Qty** in the [Removal Order Detail report](/reportcentral/REMOVAL_ORDER_DETAIL/0). 
  * Once all inventory is marked as **Completed Qty** the order status changes to **Completed**.
  * To view the estimated recovery amount for a shipped item, open a removal order from the [Removal Order Detail report](/reportcentral/REMOVAL_ORDER_DETAIL/0) and click **View recovery summary**. 
  * If your inventory was shipped to more than one liquidator, the removal order will contain multiple shipment order IDs. 

  
Day 60 (or after) | 

  * The net recovery value is available on your [Payments page](/payments/reports/statement/details). Payments should appear under each shipment order ID in your account 60 days after your liquidation order is submitted.
  * There are three different payment transaction types for FBA Liquidations:
    * **Liquidations** : This transaction type is the standard liquidations order.
    * **Liquidations Adjustment** : In cases where your inventory is damaged, lost, or not suitable for liquidations, Amazon might perform a reversal of the initial payment.
    * **Other** : If there is a liquidation adjustment, you might be eligible for a [reimbursement](/gp/help/G200213130) equivalent to the net recovery value. 
**Note:** Liquidation orders generated by Automated Unfulfillable Removals
will be executed at Amazon’s earliest discretion based on capacity, including
immediately after returns evaluation. These orders may be tracked using the
[Customer Returns Report](/reportcentral/CUSTOMER_RETURNS/0). Revenue and fees
associated with these transactions can be tracked using the Payments page
referenced above.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Who are the liquidators and what happens to my liquidated inventory?

We have contracted with liquidators who resell both Amazon-owned and FBA
inventory to downstream consumers. Liquidators are contractually restricted
from reselling FBA liquidated products directly on Amazon. These liquidators
resell liquidated inventory through other ecommerce or brick-and-mortar
channels. Liquidators cannot return liquidated inventory back to you.

#### Can I preview the gross and net recovery value before I create my
liquidation order?

No. When you submit a liquidation order, Amazon will attempt to arrange a
liquidator for this inventory. If arranged, a liquidator will purchase this
inventory for a gross recovery value, which is typically about 5% to 10% of
the product’s value. Once Amazon receives payment from a
liquidator—approximately 60-90 days after submitting the liquidation order—the
net recovery value will be available on your Payments page.

#### Does participating in FBA Liquidations affect my Inventory Performance
Index (IPI) score?

[IPI](/gp/help/202174810) measures how efficient and productive you are in
managing your FBA inventory, and excess inventory adversely affects your IPI
score. Once you submit a removal order to FBA Liquidations, the order will
show as **Pending** on the [Removal Order Detail
report](/reportcentral/REMOVAL_ORDER_DETAIL/0). Inventory that is pending
removal does not influence or adversely affect your IPI score. This is the
case for other removal options as well, such as **Dispose** and **Ship-to
address**. Therefore, liquidating inventory can help improve your sell-through
rate by reducing excess or aged inventory and positively influence your IPI
score.

#### How do liquidation orders affect my inventory storage limits?

After submitting a liquidation order, the order will move to **pending**
status in the Removal Order Detail report, and the inventory moves to
**reserved** status. This status change typically happens on the following day
after placing a liquidation order. Once the status changes, the inventory will
no longer contribute to your storage volume. For more information, go to [FBA
capacity limits](/gp/help/GAFNWEYTJUV2GBFC).

#### Can I use the inventory I submitted for liquidation to fulfill customer
orders while it is pending liquidation?

After you submit a liquidation order, there is a short window of time between
submitting a liquidation order and when the inventory is moved to reserved
status. During this period of time, customer orders can be fulfilled with your
inventory. If your inventory is used to fulfill a customer order while
liquidation is pending, you will receive the proceeds of sale rather than a
liquidation payment.

#### How can I find payments for my liquidated inventory?

You can find liquidation payments in the Payments section of Seller Central.
In the **Transaction View** , you may filter your **Transaction Type** to
Liquidations to view all associated liquidation revenue and fees. You may also
associate these transactions to the corresponding shipment ID or customer
order ID.

#### Why did I receive different payment amounts for the same liquidated ASIN?

Amazon may have different contracted liquidation rates by fulfillment center.
If you submit a liquidation order for multiple units of a single ASIN and the
units are located among multiple fulfillment centers, Amazon will attempt to
process the units that provide you with the greatest recovery value first.

#### Why was my liquidation order canceled?

We may cancel a liquidation order if the inventory isn't available for removal
(for example, if it is part of a pending customer order). The items will
display as **Canceled** in the [Removal Order Detail
report](/reportcentral/REMOVAL_ORDER_DETAIL/0) and will be returned to your
inventory. Note that monthly storage fees and aged-inventory surcharges will
resume.  If your order was canceled, submit a new one.

#### Why am I being charged a monthly storage fee, an aged-inventory
surcharge, or both, on items I submitted in a liquidation order?

Any items canceled within a liquidations order are still subject to monthly
storage fees, aged-inventory surcharges, or both. Submit a new removal order
for the canceled items. You can have your items returned or disposed of, or
choose a value recovery option such as Grade & Resell or Liquidations.

#### Why is my liquidation order taking so long to complete?

When you submit a liquidation order, we’ll attempt to fulfill your order
within 30 days. Once the order is fulfilled, liquidators have 30 days to pay
you for your liquidated items.

**Note:** Due to COVID-19, there may be delays in these estimated timelines.
However, monthly fees and aged-inventory surcharges will no longer accrue upon
liquidation order submission.

For more information, go to the **Track your Liquidations orders** section on
this page.

#### I have disabled Liquidations from my Automated unfulfillable settings.
Why am I still seeing liquidation orders being created?

Most commonly, you’re seeing incoming revenue from previous liquidation orders
that were placed before you disabled Liquidations from your Automated
unfulfillable settings. Watch the **FBA Liquidations: Payments Reporting**
video in the **Resources** section on this page to validate if what you see is
a new liquidations order, or is revenue from a previous order.

#### Why did Amazon reverse my liquidations revenue payment?

In cases where your inventory is damaged, lost, or not suitable for
liquidation, Amazon might perform a reversal of the initial payment.
Typically, this adjustment will be followed by an updated revenue payment for
a new amount.

For more information, go to the **Track your Liquidations orders** section on
this page.

#### Why haven’t I received payment for my items?

It can take up to 90 days from when the order is complete to when you receive
revenue for items in a liquidation order. Contact Selling Partner Support if
you don’t see revenue after 90 days from the completion date.

#### If I liquidate inventory, will Amazon restrict when I can send inventory
for this ASIN to a fulfillment center?

No. Such restrictions apply only to inventory you have returned to yourself
(using the Ship-to address in Seller Central) and do not apply to liquidated
ASINs. For more information about restrictions, visit [FBA aged-inventory
surcharges](/gp/help/GJQNPA23YWVA4SBD), formerly known as Long-term storage
fees.

#### What other recovery value options do I have for my excess and customer-
returned inventory?

In addition to participating in the FBA Liquidations program, you can also
earn recovery value for your excess inventory by enrolling it in [Amazon
Outlet](/gp/help/GHLYT4TPVCY2MJE3).

#### Am I able to calculate tax on items liquidated through the program?

You can use Amazon's [Tax calculation services](/gp/help/200787660) to
calculate tax on orders that are not destined for a [Marketplace tax
collection jurisdiction](/gp/help/7VYHGJ8ZT2M58CP). You can see your tax
calculations in the Sales Tax report in the [Tax document
library](/gp/tax/tax-library.html).

#### Can I use my standard Seller Central Tax Report to report liquidation
sales?

Your Seller Central Tax report determines which period to report your sales
based on the date of cash receipt and the date of shipment. Liquidation sales
will be reported in the period based on the shipment date of your items, but
the sales will not appear in the report until the liquidator has transmitted
payment to Amazon.

#### Which item-level Product Tax Code (PTC) will be used for my liquidation
order?

Your item-level PTC is assigned based on the status of the product listing at
the time your item is shipped to a liquidator:

  * Active listing: If available, your item-level PTC will be used for tax calculation.
  * Inactive listing: Your item level PTC is also considered inactive and will not be used. Instead, the default PTC assigned in your Tax Settings will be used for tax calculation.

If you do not have a default PTC assigned in your Tax Settings, we will
calculate tax at a zero rate using a PTC of “A_GEN_NOTAX” per the [Product tax
codes](/gp/help/G200794510).
