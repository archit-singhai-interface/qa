Drop shipping, or allowing a third-party to fulfill orders to customers on
your behalf, is not acceptable unless it is clear to the customer that you are
the seller of record. The following examples of drop shipping are policy
violations that may result in a restriction of your ability to sell using
Amazon’s Merchant Fulfilled Network (MFN):

  * Purchasing products from a third party, including Amazon or another seller in Amazon’s stores, and having that third party ship directly to customers, if the shipment does not identify you as the seller of record or if anyone other than you (including the third party) appears on packing slips, invoices, or external packaging, it is strictly prohibited without exception; or 
  * Shipping orders with packing slips, invoices, external packaging, or other information indicating a seller name or contact information other than your own is also strictly prohibited.

Any time a customer sees packaging, invoices, or receipts identifying a seller
that is not you it creates confusion for the customer about how their order is
being fulfilled and whom they should contact with any problems or questions.

If you intend to fulfill orders using another company’s fulfillment service, a
third-party logistics company, or a drop shipper, you must always:

  * Have an agreement with your supplier where you are the only seller of record and the only entity identified as the seller of your products on all packing slips, invoices, external packaging, or any other information included or provided in connection with the products;
  * Remove any packing slips, invoices, external packaging, or other information identifying a different seller or third-party supplier prior to shipping the order; and 
  * Remain responsible for accepting and processing customer returns, and always comply to the: [Business Solutions Agreement (BSA)](/gp/help/external/1791?language=en_US&ref=su_1791_cont_G201808410) and applicable Amazon policies.
