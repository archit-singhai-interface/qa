The step 5 is only applicable if you have chosen Amazon Partnered Carrier as a
carrier option. Once you have confirmed your pallet configurations and
accepted the shipping cost estimates in step 4 of the Send to Amazon workflow,
you can print labels for your pallets.  

  1. Select your pallet label type under Print Format.
  2. The pallet labels can be printed in three formats: Thermal Printing- 4 x 6 inches, 3-1/3" X 4" (US letter) and one label per A4 page.
  3. Click Print once you have selected the label format.
  4. Place the labels squarely (not on an angle) so the forklift driver will be able to see them.
  5. Click View Tracking Details to move to next step.

A bill of lading (BOL) will be provided for Amazon partnered carrier as a
carrier option. The BOL will be generated latest by the morning of the pickup
date. You must provide a valid BOL to the carrier or the shipment will be
refused upon delivery.
