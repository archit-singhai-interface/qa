The Brand Health page allows you to view and resolve listing issues related to
our [standards](/help/hub/reference/201797950) for brands selling on Amazon,
including:

  * Price competitiveness
  * Product sourcing eligibility 

**Note:** The Brand Health page is currently only available in the United
States for sellers that are Rights Owners or Registered Agents of a brand. To
learn more, go to [Brand Registry
roles](/help/hub/reference/GCF9UE9VGKGA2W5F).

This page outlines listings at the ASIN-level that are either unpublished or
not priced competitively, which results in a brand health issue. You can
resolve these issues by following the on-screen recommendations that are
associated with each listing.

To get started, click **Inventory** , select **Manage all inventory** , and
then **Brand Health**.

## Frequently asked questions

####  **My listing is priced competitively. Why does it appear on the Brand
Health page?**

If one of your listings is also actively sold by a retailer outside of our
store, the listing will appear on the Brand Health page.

If you see "No immediate action required" under the **Brand Health
description** column, your listing is priced competitively, your offer is
eligible to be the Featured Offer, and you don’t need to take any action.

####  **What do the different Brand Health descriptions mean?**

Brand Health description | Definition  
---|---  
FBA inbound not permitted | This message appears because we source and sell this product through a vendor that we already have a business relationship with. If you’d like to add inventory for this product through Vendor Central, contact your vendor manager, your Amazon retail contact, or the brand. To learn more, go to [Standards for brands selling in the Amazon store](/help/hub/reference/201797950). For additional support, [contact us](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/cu/contact-us) and include the code, “ASB001”, in the case.  
Listing unpublished  
Ineligible listing unpublished  
Currently ineligible to be a Featured Offer on the product detail page |  This message appears when an item isn’t competitively priced compared to retailers selling this item outside of our store (the competitive price). As a result, the listing becomes ineligible to be the Featured Offer. To restore a listing’s eligibility to be the Featured Offer, update the item’s price and shipping cost so that they’re equal to or less than the competitive price. You can also use the [Automate Pricing](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/automatepricing/home) tool to ensure that your items are always well-priced.  To learn more, go to [Featured Offer eligibility](/help/hub/reference/G200418100).  
No immediate action required | You don’t need to make any changes to your listing at this time.  
  
####  **How is the competitive price determined?**

The competitive price is the lowest price for an item when compared to other
reputable and relevant retailers outside of our store.

We regularly conduct reviews to identify reputable and relevant retailers that
provide comparable selection for each country and product group. To learn
more, go to [Pricing health](/help/hub/reference/GSTH6YN3BR8XNWBW).

####  **Are other sellers also ineligible to be the Featured Offer when their
listings are priced higher than other retailers?**

Yes. The same price competitiveness threshold applies to all sellers.
