When you ship your inventory to Amazon for fulfillment, you can be assured
that it will be stored in a secure environment.

When you send your shipments to our fulfillment centers, it is important to
follow our preparation, packaging and labeling requirements so your shipments
are received quickly and accurately.

##  How Amazon stores your inventory

We store inventory either in bulk or in individual "pickup" locations. Media
products are stored on library-type shelving in vertical, spine out positions
with loose stacking to avoid "shelf wear." Specialty items like food or high-
value goods may be placed in specific secure or climate-controlled areas of
the fulfillment center as appropriate. .

If inventory is damaged or misplaced while in Amazon's control (in the
fulfillment center or during delivery to or from a customer), we will buy the
inventory from you.

Once your inventory is received at a fulfillment center or [receive
center](/gp/help/G200735910), it is available for sale. Reconciliation of
shipped inventory may take up to 21 days. You can track the status of your
shipment in the **Shipping Queue** with the status cycling through In Transit,
Delivered, Checked-In, Receiving and finally Closed. During the Receiving
process, your item barcodes are individually scanned and entered into the
tracking system, the dimensions (to the nearest 1/10') and weight (to the
nearest 1/10 lb) are captured for storage and fulfillment purposes.

Before you ship your products to Amazon, be sure to review [FBA Inventory
Requirements](/gp/help/201100890) and [FBA Product
Restrictions](/gp/help/G200140860).
