When you set up a connection using the Build International Listings tool, it
will evaluate the offers in your source marketplace and creates offers for
eligible products in each of the selected target marketplaces.

To learn about how to use the tool to create and update offers, see [Build
International Listings](/gp/help/202121570).

## Existing connection

If you have previously set up a connection, follow the instructions to [add
more target marketplaces](/gp/help/202121640).

## New connection

To create a new connection across marketplaces using Build International
Listings:  

  1. Go to the [Build International Listings](/gp/global-selling/sync-offers) tool and click **Get started**.
  2. Choose your [source and target marketplaces](/gp/help/G202121600).
  3. Select offer creation rules.
  4. Define your default price rules.
  5. Review your settings and make sure you understand your obligations in the target marketplace.
  6. When you are ready, click the **Agree and connect** button to start the connection process.

## Second source marketplace connection

If you have used [linked accounts](/gp/help/G201841950) to connect your
Professional selling accounts for multiple regions, you can create connections
to a second source marketplace. The following guidelines apply to using a
second source marketplace:

  * A source marketplace cannot also be a target marketplace.
  * A target marketplace can be assigned to only one source marketplace.
  * A second source marketplace can be from any region except the one with your first source marketplace.

**Note:** The primary use for a second source marketplace is to allow you to
maintain regional setups for your Build International Listings marketplace.
This is not required. You can manage all of your target marketplaces using a
single source marketplace.

To create a connection for a second source marketplace using the Build
International Listings tool:  

  1. Go to the [Build International Listings](/gp/global-selling/sync-offers) dashboard and click **Add source marketplace** in the **Connection settings** widget.
  2. Choose your [source and target marketplaces](/gp/help/G202121600).
  3. Select offer creation rules.
  4. Define your default price rules.
  5. Review your settings and make sure you understand your obligations in the target marketplace.
  6. When you are ready, click the **Agree and connect** button to start the connection process. 

##  More information

Processing and creating offers may take up to four hours to complete. After
the connection is established and offers are created, a [status
report](/gp/help/G202121620) will be generated and available on the **Build
International Listings** dashboard. You will get an e-mail telling you the
process is complete, with a summary of the results.

To activate FBA offers, you must send inventory to a fulfillment center in the
target marketplace. To manage your inventory, select **Manage FBA Inventory**
from the **Inventory** drop-down menu in Seller Central.

**Tip:** If you are using the self-fulfilled method, review your shipping
settings for each marketplace to make sure the rates you set meet your
requirements. To adjust shipping settings, change the marketplace using the
marketplace switcher. You can get to your shipping settings from the
**Settings** drop-down menu in Seller Central.
