As part of Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), you have access to optional features
and services to help you manage and grow your business. FBA fees cover the
cost of storing your products in Amazon's fulfillment centers; picking,
packing, and shipping orders; and providing customer service for products
sold.

## FBA overview

closer to customers in multiple fulfillment centers across the country is
critical to delivering products faster and at a lower cost. The FBA inbound

cost of distributing inventory to fulfillment centers close to customers.

process your boxes at the fulfillment center. A per-item fee applies.

products using a barcode scanner, and then print and apply labels one at a
