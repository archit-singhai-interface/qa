Enrolling in the tax calculation service is optional and requires a
Professional selling plan. Changes to your participation in a Professional
selling plan can affect tax calculation service enrollment, settings, and
reporting availability.

Review the following situations.

## Downgrading from Professional

If you are enrolled in the tax calculation service and downgrade to an
individual account status, this action will cancel your enrollment. Consider
the following:

  * Tax reports in the [Tax Document Library](/gp/tax/tax-library.html) will no longer be available. Generate and download all tax reports prior to downgrading.
  * All tax calculation settings and functionality will be removed immediately.
  * To re-enroll in tax calculation service after downgrading, you must upgrade your account status to Professional. See information about how to re-upgrade below.

## Close and terminate a seller account

Closure of your seller account is a permanent action and you will no longer
have access to tax calculations and reporting. Prior to closing your account,
we suggest you generate and save any tax reports that you might need from the
[Tax Document Library](/gp/tax/tax-library.html).

## Upgrading to Professional (first time)

When upgrading to a Professional selling account, you have the option to
enroll in the tax calculation service. For information, see [Tax Calculation
Service Terms](/gp/help/200787220) and [Set up tax calculation
services](/gp/help/201706700).

## Re-Upgrading to Professional

If you were enrolled in a Professional selling account that used the tax
calculation service, downgrading to an Individual selling account will remove
all tax configurations. You will need to reconfigure all tax configurations if
you upgrade to a professional selling account. For instructions about
configuring tax settings, see [Set up tax calculation
services](/gp/help/201706700).

**Important:** One or more of the previous item level product tax code
assignments, default level product tax code assignment, and jurisdiction
settings will require set up to ensure accurate calculations.
