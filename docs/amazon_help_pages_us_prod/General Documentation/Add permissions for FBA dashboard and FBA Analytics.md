The FBA dashboard and the FBA Analytics tool are accessible from the
**Inventory** drop-down menu on the Seller Central homepage. They are visible
only to account users who have permissions to use the tools.

If you don't have permissions, the primary account holder for your account can
grant them to you via the [User permissions](/gp/account-manager/home.html?)
page. Amazon can’t grant permissions.

To grant permissions to an account user, follow these steps:

  1. From the **Settings** drop-down menu, select **User permissions**.

  2. Add a new user, or select an existing user.

  3. Click **Add to global account** or **Manage global permissions** to add or modify the user’s permissions. 

  4. Scroll down to the **Inventory** section and locate **FBA dashboard and FBA Analytics**. Select one of the following three levels of permissions:

Option | Description  
---|---  
**None** | These users don't have access to inventory information.  
**View and edit** | These users can take actions on inventory.  
**View only** | These users can only view inventory information.  
  

**Important:** Be careful to grant **View and edit** permissions only to users
who are authorized to act on FBA inventory or change inventory settings.
