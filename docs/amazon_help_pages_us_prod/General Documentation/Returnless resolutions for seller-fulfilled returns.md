**Note:** If you’re interested or enrolled in Fulfillment by Amazon returnless
resolutions, go to [FBA returnless resolutions](/gp/help/G3RZC8DVQCDTCQ3B) for
more information.

A returnless resolution takes place when you issue a refund or replacement and
let the buyer keep the original product. You can either automatically issue a
returnless refund or replacement via rules that you define, or work with the
buyer via messaging for a specific return.

There are two ways to configure returnless resolutions for your seller-
fulfilled returns:

  * Offer returnless resolutions for returns that meet certain criteria. 
  * Offer or remove returnless resolutions for specific SKUs.

## Offer returnless resolutions for returns that meet certain criteria

To configure your seller-fulfilled returns in this way, follow these steps:

  1. Go to your [Return settings](/gp/returns/settings/ref=id_xx_cont_202072200) and click the **Resolutions** tab.

  2. Click **Create a returnless resolution rule**.

  3. Create a rule name and set your rules.

  4. Enter the price range and click **Save**.

The newly configured rule will apply to all orders from that time forward. You
also have the option to select the product categories and reasons for return.

To edit or delete an existing rule, follow these steps:

  * To edit an existing rule, click the rule, select **Edit** , modify the settings, and click **Save**.
  * To delete a returnless resolution rule, click the rule, select **Delete** , and confirm that you want the rule deleted.

**Note:** All orders that were placed while a rule was active will still have
that rule applied.

## Offer or remove returnless resolutions for specific SKUs

To offer or remove returnless resolutions for specific products in your
inventory, follow these steps:

  1. Go to your [Return settings](/gp/returns/settings/ref=id_xx_cont_202072200) and click **Manage return templates**.

  2. Download the **Returnless resolution template** and follow the instructions in the file to either request or remove the returnless resolutions for specific SKUs.

  3. Indicate the reason code for the returnless resolution exemption.

  4. After you’ve completed the steps on the **Returnless resolution** tab in the template, make sure that no Excel filters are applied and then save the template as an Excel workbook file in an accessible location on your computer. This will allow you to make changes after you’ve uploaded the template.

  5. Save the template as a tab delimited (*.txt) file in order to upload the file. Make sure that the **Returnless resolution** tab is displayed before you save.

**Note:** The request will not process properly if you save and upload any
other tab.

  6. Go to your **Return settings** and click **Manage return templates**.

  7. Upload the **Returnless resolution** tab delimited (*.txt) file that you saved before.

## Request status for specific SKUs

To see the SKUs for which you’ve enabled returnless resolution, follow these
steps:

  1. Go to your [Return settings](/gp/returns/settings/ref=id_xx_cont_202072200) and click **Manage return templates**. 

  2. Go to **Status report** and select **Returnless resolution** from the drop-down menu. 

  3. Click **Request** to get the report. 

  4. After the report has finished processing, click **Download report**. 

## Returnless resolutions for international returns

**Returns without a US return address:**

  * If you’re fulfilling customer orders in the US from outside the US and you don’t provide a default US return address, we’ll automatically issue the buyer a refund for eligible returns that are valued at or under $25, without requiring that the item be returned. 
  * For return items that are valued above $25, we recommend that you offer the buyer a seller-prepaid return label within 48 hours of a return request. You can also offer a full refund without requesting that the item be returned (returnless refund). If you don’t provide a seller-prepaid return label or a returnless refund, we may issue a refund to the buyer on your behalf and charge the amount to your seller account.
