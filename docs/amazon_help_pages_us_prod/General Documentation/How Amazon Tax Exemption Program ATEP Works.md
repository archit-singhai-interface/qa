section: General Documentation
---

Some buyers and organizations who shop on Amazon.com qualify for sales tax
exemptions. Amazon’s Tax Exemption Program (ATEP) is an option available to
sellers using [Tax Calculation
Service](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/tax/nexus/settings) to accept
exemptions from buyers who are also enrolled in ATEP. By participating, you
will experience automatic handling of buyer exemptions directly through your
seller account.

Sellers who do not participate in ATEP or buyers who are otherwise unable to
apply their exemptions at the time of purchase may request a refund of taxes
from you. Additional information about post-order refund of taxes is available
in the [Tax Calculation Services
Terms](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G200787220).

#### How do I enroll in ATEP?

Your participation is automatic when you save your [Tax
Settings](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/tax/nexus/settings), unless you
opt-out. See [How to Enroll in
ATEP](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201641810) for more
information. A buyer and seller must both participate for a buyer to use their
exemption on your offer.

#### What is the benefit of participating in ATEP?

Sellers who participate will experience automatic handling of buyer
exemptions. Automatic handling includes collection of a buyer exemption
document, on a per order basis, storage of the document in our system with
access through your seller account [Tax Document
Library](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/tax/exemptions), whenever you need
it.

Additionally, buyers searching for products can filter their search results to
include or exclude seller offers that accept exemptions. If you choose not to
not participate, your offer may not be included in a buyers filtered search.

#### How does the exemption work?

When a participating buyer is purchasing from a participating seller, and the
buyer has an active exemption for the destination of the order, their
exemption automatically applies to all items in the order. During checkout,
the buyer may remove the exemption from one, many, or all items on the order,
if a particular item does not qualify for the exemption.

Exemptions are specific to the taxing jurisdictions that have been set up on
the buyer’s account. A buyer who has not enrolled with an exemption for the
destination of an order will not be offered an option to apply their exemption
at checkout.

#### How do I identify orders with an exemption and access the exemption
document?

To identify an order with a tax exemption, use reporting available in your
[Tax Document Library](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/tax/tax-
library.html?ref_=xx_ateprpt_rnav_taxlib). Your Sales Tax Report will populate
data in the Buyer_Exemption columns and exemption documents will be available
in the [Tax-Exemption
Certificates](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/tax/exemptions) tab within 72
hours of order completion. For more information, see the [Get Tax-Exemption
Certificates](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G201707900) page.

#### Can I access exemption documents for orders shipped to a Marketplace Tax
Collection state?

For orders destined to a Marketplace Tax Collection jurisdiction, Amazon is
responsible to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax, regardless of the
fulfillment type. You will not have access to download customer exemption
certificates for tax-exempt orders shipped to jurisdictions where
_[Marketplace Tax
Collection](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G7VYHGJ8ZT2M58CP?language=en_US&ref=ag_G7VYHGJ8ZT2M58CP_cont_G201707880)_
laws have been enacted.

#### Is ATEP participation mandatory?

No. ATEP is an optional service; however, participation may help reduce buyer
questions regarding your tax settings or requests for post-order refund of
taxes charged on an order. It is the seller’s responsibility to communicate
with any buyer to answer any tax setting related questions and process
requests for post order refund of taxes on all merchant fulfilled orders.

#### Can I issue post-order refund of taxes?

Yes. For merchant fulfilled orders, you can [issue a refund of taxes
calculated](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G202154020) on an order
at any time. For orders fulfilled by Amazon, you can direct the buyer to
Amazon Customer Service or [issue a concession
refund](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200359070) on the order.

#### What information does Amazon collect from buyers during enrollment?

The standard information collected from buyers includes the purchasing
organization name, type of individual or organization (e.g. government,
reseller, charitable organization, etc.); jurisdictions (state and/or local
jurisdictions) for which their exemption is applicable and other information,
such as signed exemption certificates when applicable.

The exemption types supported by ATEP and the specific information we collect
from buyers are available under question “What types of exemptions and
information can I expect?” towards the end of this document.

#### Does Amazon validate buyer exemption information?

Amazon will validate a buyer has provided information necessary for the
exemption type being enrolled. Buyers are responsible to provide and maintain
valid exemption information and appropriately use their exemption for
purchases. Amazon does not validate information supplied during enrollment
with any tax authority.

#### Can a buyer’s ATEP enrollment be retroactive?

No. Both buyer and seller must participate in ATEP at the time of the order
for a buyer to apply their exemption to an order. Post-order enrollment in
ATEP is not retroactive and will only be available for future orders.

A buyer may request a post-order refund of taxes from a seller or Amazon’s
customer service. Our [Tax Calculation Services
Terms](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G200787220) and the answer to
“Can I issue post-order refund of taxes?”explains when a tax refund is
supported and the party responsible to process the refund.

#### If Amazon issues a refund of taxes on FBA orders, will I receive an
exemption document?

Yes. If you participate in ATEP and a customer seeks a post-order, tax-only
refund related to an exemption for products fulfilled by Amazon, the tax will
be refunded only if Amazon receives supporting exemption documentation. The
supporting document will be made available in your [Tax Document
Library](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/tax/exemptions).

#### If I issue a refund of taxes on orders I fulfill, will Amazon supply the
buyer exemption document?

No. Similar to product refunds, any exemption that is not applied through ATEP
at the time of purchase will require a post order refund of tax to support the
exemption. Sellers are responsible to obtain, validate, and retain any
exemption documentation necessary to support a buyer’s tax only refund
request. If you issue any refund prior to obtaining any necessary
documentation, you may not be able to obtain the document.

exemption information, document, or certificates provided by the buyer and
