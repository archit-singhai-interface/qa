Amazon does not always provide prepaid return shipping labels for auto-
authorized returns. Exceptions include the following scenarios:

  * The customer's address is outside of the US. 
  * The seller's return address is outside of the US. 

For more details about Amazon's international returns policy, see [Customer
returns for international sales](/gp/help/G201468550).

  * Packages that weigh more than 150 lb, exceed 108 inches in length, or exceed a total of 165 inches in length plus girth. Length plus girth is defined as: length + 2 x width + 2 x height.
  * Some items classified as dangerous goods. 

**Note:** If the customer and seller addresses are located in the contiguous
48 states (and not from Hawaii, Alaska, or Puerto Rico), Amazon will issue
prepaid return shipping labels for items containing lithium ion (UN3481) or
metal (UN3091) batteries.

When a return is auto-authorized, we'll provide the buyer your address,
without postage. We'll send you a notification through [Manage
Returns](/gp/returns/list/ref=xx_myr_dnav_xx) to complete a manual review at
your discretion. Contact the customer to coordinate the return and issue a
refund, if appropriate. You can also issue your own prepaid return label to
the customer.
