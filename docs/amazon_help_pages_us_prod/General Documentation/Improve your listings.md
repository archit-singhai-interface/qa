You can take multiple steps to improve your listings:

  * **Improve discovery:** Customers filter their search results using specific attributes. Adding these attributes will ensure that customers don’t miss your product when it meets the customer requirements and the filters are used. 
  * **Enable the Product overview experience:** Product overview is a new experience that will highlight important product attributes above the bullet points on the product detail page. This will help customers evaluate your product easily and make a faster buying decision. 
  * **Reduce potential customer returns by adding critical product information:** Customers often return products due to a lack of critical product information on the product detail page, for example, compatibility features for headphones and cables. By adding more information, you can reduce the number of returns. 

Amazon identifies listings that need improvements and provides recommendations
on which product attributes you should provide. To view listings that have
listing quality opportunities, go to the **Inventory** menu and select
**Manage All Inventory**.

To see the detail of the opportunities, in the **Listing Status** dropdown,
click **Improve listing quality**. For each listing, you can click on the
issue to view a brief description of the attribute to be filled-in in the side
panel. After you have made changes and filled in the missing attributes, click
**Save changes**. Changes will take up to 48 hours to reflect.

Once you have addressed the opportunities, if you have additional ones, they
will show up on the list. We recommend that you review these opportunities on
a weekly basis.

To reject an opportunity you find irrelevant, click **…** and select one of
the reasons. The opportunity will disappear in 48 hours.

**Note:** You can address listings with missing attributes in bulk on the [Add
missing attributes in bulk](/quality/bulk) page.
