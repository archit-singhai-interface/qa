You can request a refund of Buy Shipping fees in accordance with the carrier's
applicable terms and conditions. The following notes apply:

  * Amazon will issue a refund only if approved by the carrier.
  * If you purchase package insurance, and your refund is approved, the insurance fee will also be refunded. If we reject a refund for any reason other than the use of an old shipping label, you might still receive a refund of the insurance fee. 
  * If you request a refund and use alternative shipping, be sure to send the buyer the new shipping and tracking information. Otherwise, the buyer will not receive an automatic notification of the change, and the original tracking information will remain associated with the order in the buyer's Amazon account.
  * If you ship a package, and confirm the shipment on time, but the carrier delivers it late, you are not obligated to issue a shipping refund to the buyer. Instead, direct the buyer to contact the carrier and request a refund based on the carrier's on-time delivery guarantee.
  * China international shipments use an off-line payment approach, therefore Sellers should contact carrier(s) directly for any refund.
