If you participate in Amazonâ€™s tax calculation services and are enrolled in
the Amazon Tax-Exemption Program (ATEP), you can get the tax-exemption
certificates from your tax-exempt sales by following these steps:

  1. Sign in to Seller Central as the primary account holder. Only the primary account holder can get tax-exemption certificates.

  2. Under **Reports** , click on [Tax Document Library.](/gp/tax/tax-library.html)

  3. Click on [Tax-Exemption Certificates](/tax/exemptions).

  4. Enter your search criteria (order ID or date range).

  5. Click the **Get report** button.

  6. Click the **Download report** button under the **Reports (CSV)** column. 

  7. Copy and paste the secure link into your browser from the downloaded report.

  8. Sign in to Seller Central. Your tax-exemption certificate will generate automatically.

**Note:** Always review the seller information on each tax-exemption
certificate report to confirm that it is accurate.
