**Products offered for sale on Amazon must be authentic. The sale of non-
authentic products is strictly prohibited. Failure to abide by this policy may
result in loss of selling privileges, funds being withheld, and disposal of
inventory in our possession.**

It is each seller’s and supplier’s responsibility to source, sell, and fulfill
only authentic products. Prohibited products include bootlegs, fakes, or
pirated copies of products or content; products that have been illegally
replicated, reproduced, or manufactured; and products that infringe another
party’s intellectual property rights. If you sell or supply inauthentic
products, we may immediately suspend or terminate your Amazon selling account
(and any related accounts) and dispose of any inauthentic products in our
fulfillment centers at your expense. In addition, we do not pay sellers until
we are confident our customers have received the authentic products they
ordered. We may withhold payments if we determine that an Amazon account has
been used to sell inauthentic goods, commit fraud, or engage in other illegal
activity.

We work with manufacturers, rights holders, content owners, vendors, and
sellers to improve the ways we detect and prevent inauthentic products from
reaching our customers. As a result, we remove suspect listings based on our
own review of products. We also work with rights holders and law enforcement
worldwide to take and support legal action against sellers and suppliers that
knowingly violate this policy and harm our customers. In addition to criminal
fines and imprisonment, sellers and suppliers of inauthentic products may face
civil penalties including the loss of any amounts received from the sale of
inauthentic products, the damage or harm sustained by the rights holders,
statutory and other damages, and attorney’s fees.

Amazon strives to ensure a trustworthy shopping experience for our customers.
By selling on Amazon, you agree that:

  * The sale of counterfeit products is strictly prohibited.
  * You may not sell any products that are not legal for sale, such as products that have been illegally replicated, reproduced, or manufactured
  * You must provide records about the authenticity of your products if Amazon requests that documentation 

Failure to abide by this policy may result in loss of selling privileges,
funds being withheld, destruction of inventory in our fulfillment centers, and
other legal consequences.

## More information

  * Sell Only Authentic and Legal Products. It is your responsibility to source, sell, and fulfill only authentic products that are legal for sale. Examples of prohibited products include:
    * Bootlegs, fakes, or pirated copies of products or content
    * Products that have been illegally replicated, reproduced, or manufactured
    * Products that infringe another party’s intellectual property rights
  * Maintain and Provide Inventory Records. Amazon may request that you provide documentation (such as invoices) showing the authenticity of your products or your authorization to list them for sale. You may remove pricing information from these documents, but providing documents that have been edited in any other way or that are misleading is a violation of this policy and will lead to enforcement against your account.

Amazon also works with manufacturers, rights holders, content owners, vendors, and sellers to improve the ways we detect and prevent inauthentic products from reaching our customers.

    * Take legal action against parties who knowingly violate this policy and harm our customers. In addition to criminal fines and imprisonment, sellers and suppliers of inauthentic products may face civil penalties including the loss of any amounts received from the sale of inauthentic products, the damage or harm sustained by the rights holders, statutory and other damages, and attorney’s fees.
