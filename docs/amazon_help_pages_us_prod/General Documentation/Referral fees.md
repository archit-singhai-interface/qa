## Fee examples

The formula for calculating the referral fee is as follows:

Referral fee = [(Item price + delivery charges + giftwrap charges) multiplied
by the category referral fee rate] OR [applicable minimum referral fee],
whichever is greater.

**Example 1: Referral fee calculations for a toy product**

Current rate: 15% of total sales price or an applicable per-item minimum
referral fee of $0.30

Item price = $25.00

Delivery charges = $4.50

Gift-wrap charges = $3.50

Total sales price = Item price + delivery charges + giftwrap charges = $33.00

Referral fee = Higher of (15% multiplied by $33.00) or $0.30 = $4.95

**Example 2: Referral fee calculations for watches of varying value**

Current rate: 16% for the portion of the total sales price up to $1,500.00,
and 3% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $1,500.00

Sales price | Example 1: Referral fee for an $8.00 watch  | Example 2: Referral fee for a $1,500.00 watch | Example 3: Referral fee for a $7,000.00 watch  
---|---|---|---  
For the portion of the total sales price up to $1,500.00 | $1.28 | $240.00 | $240.00  
For any portion of the total sales price from $1,500.01 and above | $0.00 | $0.00 | $165.00  
Referral fee  | $1.28  | $240.00  | $405.00
