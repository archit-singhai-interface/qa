When sales tax is calculated on an order, the sales tax amount will be
provided on multiple order reports with order details at a summary level.
Sales tax calculation details, such as the tax rate and taxing jurisdiction
are only available in the sales tax report.

####  **Tax Document Library: Sales Tax Report options**

  * **Sales Tax Calculation Report:** This report reflects the sales tax rate and taxing jurisdiction information for orders based on your [tax calculation settings](/tax/nexus/settings). This report is useful when you are remitting sales tax.
  * **Marketplace Tax Collection Report:** This report is informational only and reflects sales tax collected and remitted by Amazon for orders destined to a [Marketplace Tax Collection](/gp/help/G7VYHGJ8ZT2M58CP) state. Do not use this report to remit sales tax.
  * **Combined Sales Tax Report:** This report is informational only and reflects **_both_** tax calculated based on your tax settings **_and_** sales tax Amazon collected and remitted for orders destined to a Marketplace Tax Collection state. Do not use this report to remit sales tax.

####  Professional sellers have access to all three sales tax reports
following these instructions:

  

  1. Select **Reports** and click [Tax Document Library](/gp/tax/tax-library.html).
  2. Under **Sales Tax Reports** , click **Generate a tax report**.
  3. In the **Generate sales tax report** pop-up window, select the **Report Type** , and select the reporting range, either by **Month** or **Custom** dates.
  4. Click **Generate**. Your report will be available under Sales Tax Reports.

**Note:** If your Sales Tax Calculation Report is blank or only reflects
Marketplace Tax Collection orders only, confirm you have [configured your tax
settings](/gp/help/G201706700).

####  Individual sellers do not have access to sales tax reports:

Individual sellers are not eligible for tax calculation service or sales tax
reporting. Individual sellers do have access to other order reporting that
include any Marketplace Tax Collection amounts. To begin using Tax Calculation
Service, [switch to a Professional selling plan](/gp/help/G201747610).

#### Other reports with sales tax reflected:

The total amount of sales tax calculated on an order is included with seller
reports containing order details. Tax calculation details, such as the tax
rate and taxing jurisdiction are only available in the sales tax report.

For individual order details, use the [Order Details](/gp/orders-v2) or
[Transaction View](/gp/payments-account/view-transactions.html) page.

For a summary of multiple order details, use the [Date Range
Report](/payments/reports/custom/request?tbla_daterangereportstable), [Order
Report](/gp/transactions/orderPickup.html/ref=ag_orderrpt_dnav_xx_) (orders
you fulfill), or [Fulfillment
Report](/gp/ssof/reports/search.html#orderAscending=&recordType=FlatFileAllOrdersReport)
(orders fulfilled by Amazon).
