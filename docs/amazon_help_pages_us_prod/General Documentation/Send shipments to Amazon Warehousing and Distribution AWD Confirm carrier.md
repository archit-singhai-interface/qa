If you're sending your inventory via Amazon Partnered Carrier or Seller
Managed Carrier, you'll be asked to confirm carrier and pallet information in
step 4 of the Send to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution workflow, after you
print and apply box labels.

**Option 1: Amazon Partnered Carrier**

  1. Select **Amazon Partnered Carrier** , enter your warehouse contact information by clicking **Add Contact** and selecting an existing warehouse contact or providing a new contact for each shipment.

  2. Review the pallet estimates for each of the shipments. If necessary, edit the pallet configurations to ensure that the shipping cost estimates will be accurate.

  3. Confirm each shipment’s pallet configurations to display the shipping cost estimates.

  4. Confirm your **Freight ready date** for all shipments in the workflow.   

    1. Note: Freight ready dates are backed by carrier and network capacity. “Grey” dates indicate a lack of capacity for a given date

  5. Amazon will provide the lowest cost carrier by default but you can change the carrier by selecting **Change carrier.**   

    1. **Change carrier** opens a modal for carrier selection. You can filter by carrier name or shipping mode to view estimated transportation cost, shipping mode and transit time.

  6. Review all the shipping cost estimates and click **Confirm all carrier and pallet informatio** to proceed to Step 5 - [Print pallet labels](/gp/help/G6SSGPBBXX7N8YBB) (for pallet shipments with an Amazon partnered carrier only).

**Option 2: Seller Managed Carrier**

  1. Select Non-Amazon Partnered Carrier.

  2. Select the carrier code from the drop-down menu under **Non-Amazon partnered carrier**. If your carrier’s code is not listed, select **Other.**

## Amazon Warehousing and Distribution FAQ

#### What if I need to cancel my shipments?

To cancel an **Amazon Partnered Carrier** confirmed order, click **Cancel
Shipment** located at the bottom right.

**Note:** Shipment cannot be canceled once they are picked up. Also, for
shipments canceled after 60 minutes from the time of booking, sellers will not
get refund of the shipping charges. If sellers haven't completed the initial
two steps and want to cancel the shipment midway, they can select the **Delete
Workflow** option at the bottom right.

To cancel a non-Amazon partnered carrier confirmed order, click **Cancel
Shipment** from the **Send to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution** page. If
you have not completed the first two steps and want to cancel the in-transit
shipment, click **Delete Workflow.**

#### How are pallet estimates calculated?

AWD uses box content information that you provided in the previous steps to
build the pallet estimates. We use a 3D model to determine the optimal number
and fit of packages on a pallet, and the optimal number of pallets per
shipment.
