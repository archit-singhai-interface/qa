Sellers are responsible for setting their own prices on Amazon stores. In our
mission to be Earth's most customer-centric company, we strive to provide our
customers with the largest selection, at the lowest price, and fastest
delivery as sellers play an important role in achieving this mission.

Amazon regularly monitors the prices of items on our stores, including
shipping costs, and compares them with other prices available to our
customers. If we see pricing practices on a store offer that harms customer
trust, Amazon can remove the Featured Offer, remove the offer, suspend the
ship option, or in serious or repeated cases suspend or terminate selling
privileges.

Pricing practices that harm customer trust include, but are not limited to:

  * Setting a reference price on a product or service that misleads customers;
  * Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon;
  * Selling multiple units of a product for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product;
  * Setting a shipping fee on a product that is excessive. Amazon considers current public carrier rates, reasonable handling charges, as well as buyer perception when determining whether a shipping price violated our fair pricing policy.
