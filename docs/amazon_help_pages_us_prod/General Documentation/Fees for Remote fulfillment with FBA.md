---

Remote fulfillment with FBA fees cover the cost of cross-border fulfillment to
Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Remote fulfillment fees replace the standard
fulfillment fees in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Standard US fulfillment fees
apply for sales in the US.

The fees referenced in the rate tables below are based on the store where the
product was purchased.

## Fee factors

**Time of charge** | When the buyer’s order is shipped  
---|---  
**Fee structure** | Per unit fulfilled at a rate that’s based on size tier and shipping weight  
  
## Values used to calculate fee

**Product size tier** | The product size tiers are based on the unit weight, product dimensions, and dimensional weight of a packaged item. To learn more, go to [Product size tiers](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W). To view the size-tier information for products that you’ve previously sent to fulfillment centers, go to your [Monthly Storage Fees report](/gp/ssof/reports/search.html?recordType=STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES).  
---|---  
**Shipping weight** | Shipping weight is the item weight that’s used to determine fees and is calculated based on the item’s unit weight or dimensional weight. To learn more, go to [Shipping weight](/gp/help/external/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY).  
**Dimensional weight** | In certain cases, dimensional weight is used instead of unit weight to determine the shipping weight. For more information, go to [Dimensional weight](/gp/help/external/G53Z9EKF8VVZVH29).

1\. Uses unit weight. All other size bands use greater of unit weight or
dimensional weight.

2\. For definitions of new size bands, go to [Product Size
Tiers](/gp/help/external/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W).

## Product size tier is determined by:

  1. Volume and dimensions of the product.

  2. Unit weight and [dimensional weight](/gp/help/G53Z9EKF8VVZVH29) of the product. 

Find the row in the table below with measurements that **do not exceed** the
weight or the dimensions of your item.

**Product size tier** | **Greater of unit weight or dimensional weight** | **Longest side** | **Median side** | **Shortest side** | **Length + girth**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
**Small standard-size** | Up to 16 oz | Up to 15 inches | Up to 12 inches | Up to 0.75 inch | Not applicable  
**Large standard-size** | Up to 20 lb | Up to 18 inches | Up to 14 inches | Up to 8 inches | Not applicable  
**Large bulky** | Up to 50 lb | Up to 59 inches | Up to 33 inches | Up to 33 inches | Up to 130 inches  
**Extra-large 0 to 50 lb** | Up to 50 lb | Extra-large exceeds 59 inches for the longest side, 33 inches for the median side, 33 inches for the shortest side, or 130 inches for length + girth, or the product’s greater of unit weight or dimensional weight exceeds 50 lb.  
**Extra-large 50+ to 70 lb** | 50+ to 70 lb  
**Extra-large 70+ to 150 lb** | 70+ to 150 lb  
  
The greater of unit weight or dimensional weight will be used to calculate
fees for large standard, large bulky, and extra-large units. Small standard
uses unit weight to calculate fees.

## How to determine the shipping weight

  1. Determine the volume and dimensions of the product.

  2. Determine the size tier of the product.

  3. Determine the unit weight of the product, which is the weight of an individual product in the packaging provided by the manufacturer.

  4. Determine the dimensional weight and whether it’s used to calculate the fees for the product. The dimensional weight is equal to the product volume (length x width x height) divided by 139. The dimensional weight for large bulky and extra-large items assumes a minimum width and height of 2 inches.

  5. Use the table below to determine the shipping weight of the product.

**Important:** If a product is sold as a set, the weight and dimensions are
the total weight and dimensions of the set packaged together.

#### Small standard-size products

For small standard-size products, the shipping weight is calculated for each
product using the unit weight.

#### Large standard-size, large bulky, and extra-large products

For large standard-size, large bulky, and extra-large products, Amazon uses
dimensional weight when it’s greater than the unit weight. The dimensional
weight for large bulky and extra-large products assumes a minimum width and
height of 2 inches.

**Size tier** | **Shipping weight**  
---|---  
Small standard size | Unit weight  
Large standard size | The greater of the unit weight or dimensional weight  
Large bulky | The greater of the unit weight or dimensional weight  
Extra-large 0 to 50 lb, 50+ to 70 lb, and 70+ to 150 lb  | The greater of the unit weight or dimensional weight
