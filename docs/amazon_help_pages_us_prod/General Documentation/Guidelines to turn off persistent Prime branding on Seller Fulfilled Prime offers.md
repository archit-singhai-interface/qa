If you've disabled Prime offers for all of your items or updated shipping
template assignments to disable Prime for a subset of items, but Prime
branding does not appear to turn off on Amazonâ€™s website, follow these steps
to troubleshoot the issue.

  1. Confirm you are signed in to a Prime customer account when viewing your SKU or ASIN and confirm that your offer is featured on the detail page.

  2. If you made a change at the shipping template level to remove Prime offers, confirm that your SKU or ASIN is not associated to a Prime shipping template. Go to **Inventory** , select **Manage seller fulfilled products** and type in the SKU or ASIN in the **Search** option. With the **Status** field filtered to **Non-Prime** , ensure your SKU or ASIN is displayed in the search results and the **Offer status** field is listed as **Non-Prime**. Also, note the name of the shipping template being used in the **Shipping template** field. Go to **Shipping settings** > **Shipping templates** and find the noted shipping template and confirm Prime delivery is not enabled.

  3. If you disabled Prime offers for all items, go to **Settings** > **Shipping settings** > **General shipping settings** > **Control Prime order volume** and verify if the **Enable/Disable Prime** option is set to **Prime offers disabled**.

  4. If the any of the above steps do not work, contact [Selling Partner Support](/help/hub/support).
