**Important:** Information on this page does not constitute tax, legal, or
other professional advice and must not be used as such. You should consult
your professional advisers if you have questions.

Based on the destination of your order, Amazon may be legally obligated to
calculate, collect, and remit applicable national, state, or local sales or
use taxes, goods and services taxes (GST), or value added taxes (VAT)
(collectively referred to as **Taxes**).

Marketplace tax collection applies to all products, from all sellers, on all
Amazon marketplaces, when an order is shipping to a jurisdiction (country,
state, county, city, district) where Marketplace Facilitator laws have been
enacted. All sellers must agree to automatic Marketplace Tax Collection,
irrespective of their location, product or order origin, or the volume or
quantity of sales made by the seller.

The buyer pays the Taxes collected by Amazon on the product sold. The
collected amounts are reflected on your order details and order reporting with
a deduction (using the reporting identifiers in the table below) equal to the
amount of Amazon’s obligation to remit to the appropriate government
authority. Additional information about the different taxes are available on
the respective FAQ page links below.

Amazon remits the collected amounts to the appropriate government authority as
Amazon, based on applicable law. If the taxes amount deducted by Amazon is
less than the amount collected from the buyer, the difference remains the
seller’s responsibility to remit to the appropriate government authority.
Amazon does not report or remit taxes on behalf of any seller to government
authorities.
