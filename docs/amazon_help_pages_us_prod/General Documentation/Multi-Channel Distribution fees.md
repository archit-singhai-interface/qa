Multi-Channel Distribution orders incur Amazon Warehousing and Distribution
(AWD) storage and processing fees since the inventory stored in AWD
distribution centers can be used for replenishment to Amazon’s fulfillment
network or your other sales channels (off-Amazon). For off-Amazon
replenishment orders, a Multi-Channel Distribution transportation fee is
charged.

Until March 31, 2025, Multi-Channel Distribution orders are charged the AWD
processing fee of $2.50 per box if your seller account is on the base rate,
and $2.13 per box if your seller account is on the integrated rate. The
transportation fee is $1.65 per cubic foot for Multi-Channel Distribution
orders.

There are no incremental fees for customized box labeling that may be
performed as part of Multi-Channel Distribution.

**Effective April 1, 2025** , Multi-Channel Distribution orders will be
charged the AWD processing fee separately at inbound and outbound. For more

fees](/help/hub/reference/GAYG62Q3MPE6STFS).

## Multi-Channel Distribution outbound transportation fee

Starting on April 1, 2025, the Multi-Channel Distribution outbound
transportation fee will be distance-based and determined based on shipping
weight and the shipping method you select.

While creating a replenishment order, you can choose between palletized load
and box load (often referred to as small parcel delivery) for outbound
delivery to your distribution channels. The palletized load option combines
boxes into a pallet for delivery, and for small parcel delivery the boxes are
delivered directly.

Box load (small parcel delivery) | Palletized load (LTL/TL)  
---|---  
| **Distance in miles *** | **Fee per pound**  
---|---  
0-150 | $0.43  
151-300 | $0.49  
301-600 | $0.53  
601-1000 | $0.65  
1001-1400 | $0.80

## Determine your shipping weight

Shipping weight (up to one decimal place) is determined by the actual weight
of your box or pallet, or the dimensional weight, whichever is greater. The
dimensional weight for each box (small parcel delivery) is equal to length x
width x height (in inches) divided by 139. For pallets, it’s equal to length x
width x height (in inches) divided by 250.

## Shipping weight examples

#### Box load - Actual weight is greater than dimensional weight

Dimensions: 6.3 x 6.2 x 4.8 inches

Box weight: 13 lb

Dimensional weight: 1.3 lb

Shipping weight = 13 lb

#### Pallet load – Actual weight is less than dimensional weight

Dimensions: 48 x 40 x 42 inches

Pallet weight: 250 lb

Dimensional weight: 322.6 lb

Shipping weight = 322.6 lb
