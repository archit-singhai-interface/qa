**Individual sellers:** This feature is available to sellers with
[Professional selling plans](/gp/help/64491).

You can use inventory file templates to add multiple product listings at the
same time. These templates are tab-delimited text files (.txt) that include
all the information needed to list your products on Amazon.

We recommend that you have a basic understanding of data files before
attempting to use inventory file templates.

Watch this [Seller University](/learn/ref=help_page) video tutorial **Match or
create product listings in bulk** for more information:

  * Install a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, if you don't already have one on your computer. 
  * Identify the product category for your products and download the appropriate template on [Add Products via Upload](/listing).
  * Request approval, if necessary, to sell in specific product categories. To learn more, go to [Products that require approval](/gp/help/G200333160).
  * [Search for your products](/help/hub/reference/G1641) in our catalog using a prefilled template, or [match your products](/gp/help/G1471) to items in our catalog using product identifiers. We will create listings for your products, based on information that you include in your file, in this order:  

    1. **Search for products using a product identifier:** Use an ISBN, UPC, EAN, or ASIN to find items that are already in our catalog. Go to [Upload inventory using the Listing Loader](/help/hub/reference/G200231860) to download a pre-filled template.
    2. **Match ISBN, UPC, or EAN:** If you're not using a pre-filled template and your file includes a product identifier (ISBN, UPC, or EAN) for any product and a matching identifier exists on Amazon, we will attempt to find a match for your product.
    3. **Match manufacturer or bibliographic information:** If your file doesn't include ISBN, UPC, or EAN identifiers for a particular product, we will attempt to match based on manufacturer or bibliographic information that you've submitted in your file. An exact match is required to create a listing.
    4. **Create new listings:** If we cannot find matches to our existing catalog using product identifiers or manufacturer or biographical information, and you provide enough data in the upload file, we will create new product pages for those listings.

Your inventory will then reflect on these pages to create offers for
customers. If there is insufficient information to match to existing pages or
to create new pages, you will receive an error message in the processing
report, after your upload. Use this report to diagnose and correct errors in
the file you uploaded. When you're ready to upload the edited file, click
**Return to upload page** and re-upload your file.
