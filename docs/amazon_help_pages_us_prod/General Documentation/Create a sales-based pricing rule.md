You can create an Automate Pricing rule based on your sales performance. For
example, you can create rules to decrease your price if your unit sales go
below a certain threshold by the end of a time interval you set, based on the
following parameters:

  * Time interval to evaluate unit sales (options include once every 1, 7, 10, 14, or 30 days)
  * Unit sales thresholds (above or below) during the time interval
  * Percentage or monetary amount to decrease price
  * Minimum and maximum price for the SKU

To create a sales-based pricing rule, do the following:

  1. Go to Pricing > [Automate Pricing](/automatepricing/home), then click **Get started**. If you have already created a pricing rule and want to create another, click **Create a new pricing rule** on the same page.

  2. For the type of rule you want to create, choose **Based on sales units** from the drop-down menu.

  3. Enter a name for the rule. This name should be short but descriptive enough to remember later; for example, "Sales below 10" or "Holiday Sales rule". Click **Continue to select marketplace(s)**.

  4. Select the checkbox for the marketplaces you want to create the rule. You can select more than one marketplace. Click **Save and continue** to select rule parameters.

  5. Specify the unit sales thresholds on which you want to lower your price. For example, you can choose to decrease your price if your unit sales drop below 10 in the past 14 days. In this example, the price decrease (if any) would take place on the 15th day.

  6. Define the amount by which you want the automatic price action to trigger, either as a monetary amount or a percentage. For example, if your unit sales drop below 10 in the past 14 days, you could decide to decrease your price by 5% or $10 on the 15th day. Note that you must enter a minimum value of at least 1% or $0.10, and the maximum percentage you can enter is 90%.

  7. Choose how often you want to run this rule. The options for the time interval are once at the end of every 1, 7, 10, 14, or 30 days.

  8. To confirm your rule parameters, read the rule summary that appears below the filters. For example, your rule summary might read "Once every 7 days, if sales are less than 10 units, the SKU price will decrease by 10%".

  9. When you are finished with one marketplace, click **Save this rule**.

  10. If you would like to create this rule in more than one marketplace, expand the window for the next marketplace and repeat steps 5-9 until you have selected rule parameters for all the marketplaces that you want to create this rule.

  11. When you are finished, select **Continue to select SKUs** to move to the next step in the Automate Pricing workflow. Automate Pricing will not change any prices on your SKUs until you assign SKUs to your rule.   

  12. In the **Edit SKUs** page for your new sales-based pricing rule, set a minimum price and maximum price for each SKU you add to the rule.

**Note:** You can also apply or remove SKUs in bulk from a sales-based pricing
rule using the Automate Pricing Regional file template once you create your
rule in Automate Pricing. To do this, follow the instructions on our Help
page, [Manage SKUs using Regional Automate Pricing file](/gp/help/202166010)
