To calculate tax for any non-[Marketplace Tax
Collection](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G7VYHGJ8ZT2M58CP) state
or jurisdiction, you must register with the appropriate tax authority to
obtain a tax registration number before collecting any sales and use tax.

Amazonâ€™s [Tax Calculation
Service](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G200787660) requires your
state tax registration number to set up tax calculation settings for any
jurisdiction you would like to enable to calculate sales and use taxes on your
products.

If you registered for a Streamlined Sales Tax ID (SSTID), individual states
will also issue a unique state tax registration number in connection with your
Streamline registration. Only use the unique state tax registration number
issued by each state when setting up your Tax Calculation Settings. Your SSTID
is for communications within the Streamline program, do not use your SSTID for
your Tax Calculation Settings.

Once you have your state tax registration number, you can move forward with
[Setting up Tax Calculation
Services](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201706700?language=en_US&ref=ag_201706700_cont_G201706660).

Sellers remain responsible for any remittance and/or reporting obligations
they may have with any state or taxing jurisdiction.

If you have any questions about registering with a state, obtaining a state
tax registration number, remittance, or reporting obligations, contact your
tax advisor and/or the specific tax authority for additional information.
