If you are an Amazon Seller, you may use the “Available at Amazon” badge (the
“Badge”) provided below and if you comply with the Trademark Usage Guidelines
(“Guidelines”) on this page. If you comply with the Guidelines, you do not
need any further approval from Amazon to use the Badge. The Guidelines include
requirements that:

  * You use the Badge only to advertise that your products are available for purchase on an Amazon website.
  * You not alter the Badge in any manner, and it must appear in its entirety.
  * You may not use the Badge in any manner that implies sponsorship or endorsement by Amazon.
  * You may not use any Amazon logos or other Amazon trademarks, other than the Badge, in your online or offline marketing materials (including product listings on Amazon websites) unless you have written permission from Amazon.

####  **Trademark Usage Guidelines**

These Guidelines apply to your use of the Badge, which is a trademark owned
solely by Amazon. As used in these Guidelines, the term "we," "us," or
"Amazon" means Amazon Services LLC or any of its affiliate companies, and
"you" means the seller (either a person or business entity) using the Badge.
Strict compliance with these Guidelines is required at all times, and any use
of the Badge in violation of these Guidelines will automatically terminate any
license related to your use of the Badge.

  

  1. You are allowed to use the Badge only to advertise the availability of your products on an Amazon website. You may use the Badge only (a) on your own website, (b) in online advertisements, and/or (c) in offline advertisements. 
  2. You are allowed to link the Badge to an Amazon website. 
  3. You may use the Badge solely for the purpose expressly authorized by Amazon in these Guidelines, and your use must: (i) comply with the most up-to-date version of these Guidelines; and (ii) comply with any other terms, conditions, or policies that Amazon may issue from time to time that apply to the use of the Badge. 
  4. Below is the approved Badge image for you to use. You may not alter the Badge in any manner, including but not limited to, changing the proportion, color, or font of the Badge, or adding or removing any element(s) to or from the Badge. 
  5. The Badge must appear in its entirety, with reasonable spacing between each side of the Badge and other visual, graphic, or textual elements. Under no circumstance should the Badge be placed on any background that interferes with the readability or display of the Badge.
  6. Do not use the Badge as part of a sentence. For example, do not say, "Our products are (Badge), so please shop online."
  7. You may not use the Badge in any manner that implies sponsorship or endorsement by Amazon, other than by using the Badge as specifically authorized in these Guidelines by Amazon. 
  8. You may not use the Badge to disparage Amazon, its products or services, or in a manner that, in Amazon's sole discretion, may diminish or otherwise damage or tarnish Amazon or Amazon's goodwill in the Badge or any other Amazon trademarks. 
  9. Unless otherwise approved, product images must not include any Amazon logos or other trademarks, or variations, modifications or anything confusingly similar to Amazon's logos and other trademarks. This includes, but is not limited to, any words or logos with the terms AMAZON, PRIME, ALEXA, or the Amazon Smile design, as well as other Amazon badges, including “Amazon's Choice,” “Premium Choice,” “Amazon Alexa,” “Works with Amazon Alexa,” “Best Seller,” or “Top Seller.” 
  10. You may include the following statement in and on any materials that display the Badge (hard copy or electronic): "Amazon's trademark is used under license from Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates." 
  11. You acknowledge that all rights to the Badge, and all other Amazon trademarks, are the exclusive property of Amazon, and all goodwill generated through your use of the Badge will inure solely to the benefit of Amazon. You will not take any action that conflicts with Amazon's rights in, or ownership of, the Badge, or any other Amazon trademarks.

**Amazon reserves the right, exercisable at its sole discretion, to modify
these Guidelines and/or the approved Badge and to take appropriate action
against any use without permission or any use that does not conform to these
Guidelines.**
