To make it easier for you to automate your pricing decisions with Automate
Pricing, Amazon has created pre-defined rules for you. Simply add SKUs to a
pre-defined rule to start repricing.

## What is Best Price Rule?

Best Price Rule automatically calculates the prices based on multiple factors
including similar product prices, historical selling prices, Buy Box eligible
prices and customer feedback for your products, within the Minimum and Maximum
price guardrails you set.

## What is the Competitive Price Rule by Amazon?

The Competitive Price rule by Amazon is a rule that offers pre-defined
configurations recommended by Amazon to increase your likelihood of being the
Featured Offer. The Featured Offer is the offer selected when the customer
clicks the ‘Add to Cart’ button on the product detail page. The Competitive
Price rule matches the Featured Offer price for the same ASIN and conditions.
In addition, it will continue to reprice after you update prices elsewhere.

**Note:** You cannot edit or delete pre-defined pricing rules.

To create a new pricing rule, use the [Automate Pricing
tool](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/automatepricing/home).
