  2. Determine the [product size tier](/gp/help/G5KW835AHDJCH8W) of the item.

  3. Determine the [unit weight](/gp/help/GE3VC5FGJE9TYJKM) of the item.

  4. Determine the [dimensional weight](/gp/help/G53Z9EKF8VVZVH29) and if it’s used to calculate fees for the item.

## Additional fees

Additional fees and surcharges may apply to MCF orders, which include the
following:

  * [Lithium batteries](/gp/help/G9RJJ3KFHSF6YRAG) and items that contain lithium batteries will incur an additional $0.11 per units to the base fulfillment fee.
  * If you [block your MCF orders from being shipped by Amazon Logistics](/gp/help/G200332450#mnd_2jc_jcb-6), it will result in a 5% surcharge on your MCF orders.*
  * Any orders shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will include a remote area surcharge of 100% for standard-size items and 200% for large bulky and extra-large items.*
  * All nonfulfillment fees, such as storage, labeling, or fees to inbound and remove your inventory from Amazon fulfillment centers, will continue to be the same for MCF as for FBA. For more information, go to [FBA features, services, and fees](/gp/help/G201074400). 

*The surcharges for blocking Amazon Logistics or for remote area delivery are calculated after adding any applicable lithium battery fees to the item’s base fulfillment fee.

## Examples of additional order fees

The following example illustrates the additional MCF fee structure for a
single-unit, small standard-size item (4+ to 8 oz) that’s being shipped at
standard speed to Hawaii. The item contains a lithium battery and Amazon
Logistics is blocked as a carrier.

Single-unit order

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/fees/mobileDeviceCase._V522446436_.png) |  **E-book reader** Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.42 inches Unit weight: 5.56 oz Rounded shipping weight: 6 oz  
**Base fulfillment fee: small standard size (4+ to 8 oz)**  
**Standard delivery speed rate** | $7.15  
**Lithium battery fee** | $0.11  
**Total base fulfillment fee** | ($7.15 + $0.11) = **$7.26**  
**Additional surcharges**  
**Block Amazon Logistics** | ($7.26 x 5%) = $0.36  
**Remote area delivery** | ($7.26 x 100%) = $7.26  
**Total surcharges** | ($0.36 + $7.26) = **$7.62**  
****Total fulfillment fee****  
Base fulfillment fee ($7.26) + surcharges ($7.62) = **$14.88**  
  
The following example illustrates the additional MCF fee structure for a two-
unit order that contains one small standard-size item (4+ to 8 oz) and one
large standard-size item (1+ to 2 lb) that’s being shipped at standard speed
to Hawaii. Both items contain lithium batteries and Amazon Logistics is
blocked as a carrier.

**Base fulfillment fee: large standard size (1+ to 2 lb)**  
**Two-unit standard delivery speed rate** | $6.94  
**Lithium battery fee** | $0.11  
**Total base fulfillment fee** | ($6.94 + $0.11) = **$7.05**  
**Additional surcharges**  
**Block Amazon Logistics** | ($5.03 + $7.05) x 5% = $0.60  
**Remote area delivery** | ($5.03 + $7.05) x 100% = $12.08  
**Total surcharges** | ($0.60 + $12.08) = **$12.68**  
**Total fulfillment fee**  
Base fulfillment fees ($5.03 + $7.05) + surcharges ($12.68) = **$24.76**
