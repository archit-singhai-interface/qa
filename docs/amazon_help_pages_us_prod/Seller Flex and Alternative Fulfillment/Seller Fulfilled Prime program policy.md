Sellers who participate in Seller Fulfilled Prime must meet the requirements
outlined in this policy for all items enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime
("Prime items").

The below requirements are subject to change by Amazon.

If Amazon determines that a seller's actions or performance may result in harm
to customer trust, violations of our terms or policies, or cause other risks
to customers or Amazon, then we may, in our sole discretion, disable or remove
applicable Prime item offers, Seller Fulfilled Prime eligibility, or selling
privileges.

For more information, go to [Maintain enrollment in Seller Fulfilled
Prime](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201812270).

## Customer service

All post-order contacts from Prime customers regarding Prime items will be
directed to Amazon Customer Service. Amazon will provide, and have sole
discretion in determining, all post-order customer service, including customer
returns, refunds, and adjustments, related to Prime items. Amazon has sole
discretion over whether to charge the costs of any returns, refunds or other
adjustments and concessions related to Prime items to the seller's account.
Sellers remain responsible for pre-order buyer inquiries and inquiries related
to their products.

## Minimum handling times

For orders received before order cut-off, sellers must ship same-day, one-day,
and two-day orders the same day that they are received (zero-day handling
time). Handling time for standard shipping to Prime customers must be 1-day or
same-day/0-day.

## Minimum order cut-off times

Sellers must configure order cut-off times to 2:00 p.m. or later local time
Monday-Friday and 10:30 a.m. or later Saturday and Sundays.

## Offer listings

Sellers cannot create separate offers for the same ASIN and list one of them
as a Seller Fulfilled Prime offer and the other as a Seller Fulfilled offer
without Prime. Offers on the same ASIN that have the same attributes,
conditions, and condition notes are considered identical offers.

## Performance requirements

Performance requirements are monitored and enforced weekly against the minimum
performance thresholds. For offers and orders to Prime customers, Sellers must
consistently meet the thresholds defined below for each requirement to retain
their program eligibility. For more information, go to [Seller Fulfilled Prime
performance
requirements](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G202072550).

  * **On-time delivery:** 93.5% or more of SFP units delivered to Prime customers must be delivered on-time.
  * **Valid tracking:** 99% or more of SFP packages shipped to Prime customers must have a valid first scan from an Amazon-integrated carrier.
  * **Cancellation rate:** Cancel no more than 0.5% of Prime customer units.
  * **Delivery speed:** Prime customer detail page views, where your offer is featured, must meet the following speed thresholds:

## Holiday season speed requirements for Seller Fulfilled Prime in the US

From November 24, 2024, through January 4, 2025, we’re updating the US speed
requirements for Seller Fulfilled Prime eligibility that apply to the holiday
season.

These updates are designed to help you navigate logistical challenges that can
affect sellers and carriers during this time of year, such as increased demand
or weather issues, while ensuring that buyers have a great Prime delivery
experience.

To maintain Seller Fulfilled Prime eligibility during the holiday season, page
views of your Prime offers must meet the following updated delivery-speed
requirements for each size category:

 | **2024 Holiday peak season  ****requirements (New)**| **Current Non-holiday peak seasons requirements (No change)**  
---|---|---  
**Size tier**| **≤ 1 day**| **≤ 2 days**| **≤ 1 day**| **≤ 2 days**  
Standard-size| ≥ 20%| ≥ 50%| ≥ 30%| ≥ 70%  
Oversize| ≥ 5%| ≥ 30%| ≥ 10%| ≥ 45%  
Extra large| N/A| ≥ 15%| N/A| ≥ 15%  
  
  

If your performance falls below these required thresholds, you may lose your
Seller Fulfilled Prime eligibility.

To view your speed performance, go to the [Seller Fulfilled Prime performance
dashboard](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/seller-fulfilled-prime/seller-
performance).

For more information, go to [Seller Fulfilled Prime program
policy](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/G201812300).

## Professional selling account

Sellers must have an account with an Amazon Professional selling plan, and the
account must be active and in good standing. Sellers must maintain their
Amazon Professional selling plan status to remain eligible for Seller
Fulfilled Prime.

## Prime badge display

For offers with longer delivery times, we may not show the Prime badge, since
the offers don’t meet Prime customers' expectations for delivery speed. Prime
customers buying your Seller Fulfilled Prime items will continue to receive
other benefits of Prime, including Amazon customer service and free returns.

## Prime order limit per shipping day

Your daily order limit is the number of Amazon Seller Fulfilled Prime orders
that you can reliably ship every day. Sellers must configure a Prime order
limit per shipping day. For more information on setting and updating your
limit, go to [Disable Prime offers and control Prime order
volume](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G202118910).

## Returns

To ensure a great customer experience, all Prime items are subject to Amazon's
return policies. Prime items will have [auto-authorization of
returns](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200828040)
initiated within that item's return window, as when you enroll the item in
Prime no further action is needed for returns to be auto-authorized. Amazon
Customer Service may make case-by-case exceptions to the return policies,
including accepting returns for Prime items past stated return time frames. Go
to **Customer service** above for more details.

## Customer service and returns requirements and policies

**Item**| **Policy or requirements**  
---|---  
**General return expectations**|  Buyers requesting to return a Prime item
within Amazon's return policy will have their return approved immediately and
will receive a pre-paid return mailing label.  
**Return shipping location**|  All returns of Seller Fulfilled Prime items
will be shipped to the return address provided in the **Account Info** page,
in **Settings**.  
**Charges for the return shipping label**|  Sellers will be responsible for
the cost of return shipping labels for all Prime items, except as outlined
below.  
**Refund processing time**|  All returned Prime items must be processed and
refunded within two business days of the item arriving in a seller’s
warehouse.  
**Refund amount**|  Generally, you must grant a full refund to the customer
when a customer returns a Prime item, subject to the following exceptions:

  1. Items that are received more than 15 days after the return window ends may have a late fee of up to 20% of the item price deducted.
  2. Items that are damaged, missing parts, not in the original condition, or have obvious signs of use for reasons not due to a seller error may have up to 50% of the item price deducted.
  3. Open software may have up to 100% of the item price deducted.

  
**Delivery refunds**|  If buyers state they have not received delivery of a
Prime item even if the package tracking information indicates it was
"delivered" then they should be directed to Amazon Customer Service.  
**Customer returns exceptions**|  To ensure a great customer experience,
Amazon may make case-by-case exceptions to the return policies, including
accepting returns for Prime items past the stated returns time frame. If
Amazon accepts a return within the 15 days following the end of the stated
returns window, the return must be processed the same as if the product was
received during the returns window.  
  
Sellers are responsible for the return shipping cost of any Seller Fulfilled
Prime items that Prime buyers return, if the item is less than 50 lb.

If the item is 50 lb or more, the charges for return shipping are dependent on
the reason codes as defined in the [Return reason codes for prepaid
returns](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G202080050). The
cost of return shipping may be deducted from the buyer's refund if the return
reason is considered "Customer" fault. If the return reason is considered
"Seller" fault, the seller is responsible for the return shipping cost.

Most Seller Fulfilled Prime items that are classified as hazardous material
("hazmat") or potentially hazmat are not returnable by customers. Unreturnable
items will be blocked in the Online Return Centers. However, customers will be
able to call Amazon Customer Service for a refund on these items and Amazon
Customer Service might issue a refund for unreturnable items in its sole
discretion. Amazon might charge the costs of any refunds to the seller's
account. If you believe an item has been incorrectly classified as hazmat,
contact Selling Partner Support for assistance.

## Shipping

Sellers are responsible for configuring their shipping templates to have
delivery regions sufficient to meet one-day and two-day delivery speed
requirements. For more information, go to [Seller Fulfilled Prime performance
requirements](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G202072550).

Sellers must provide nationwide contiguous US delivery with free standard
shipping for all Prime and non-Prime customers. Regions configured for same-
day, one-day, and two-day delivery must provide free shipping for Prime
customers but a shipping charge can be configured for non-Prime customers in
these delivery regions. If Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico are enabled as a
Prime delivery region on your shipping template, free standard shipping is
required to Prime customers in these regions.

For more information, go to [Seller Fulfilled Prime shipping
requirements](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G202098380).
