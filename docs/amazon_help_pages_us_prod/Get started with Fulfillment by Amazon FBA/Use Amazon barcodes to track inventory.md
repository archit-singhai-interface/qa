title: Use Amazon barcodes to track inventory

section: Get started with Fulfillment by Amazon FBA

Amazon systems are barcode-driven. Each unit you send to a fulfillment center
requires a barcode so that it can be tracked throughout the fulfillment
process.

Products that don't use a manufacturer barcode for tracking require an Amazon
barcode. You can print Amazon barcodes from within your seller account and
apply the barcodes yourself.

If you donâ€™t want to apply the barcodes yourself, you can sign up for the [FBA
Label Service](/gp/help/200483750) and have Amazon apply the labels for you
for a per-item fee.

For eligible products, you can use the manufacturer barcode to track your
inventory. For more information, go to [Using manufacturer barcodes with FBA
virtual tracking](/gp/help/200141480).

Any item that requires an Amazon barcode that arrives at a fulfillment center
without one will be subject to an unplanned prep service fee. For more
information, go to [Unplanned services](/gp/help/201000230).

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory, blocking
of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for preparation or
for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

## Amazon barcode label requirements

When printing Amazon barcodes onto labels, make sure that the printed labels
match the formatting of the Seller Central generated label:

  * Sufficient white space around the Amazon barcode and related text: (0.25 inch on the sides and 0.125 inch on the top and bottom)
  * Sufficient white space around the label content and the edges (0.25 inch on the sides and 0.125 inch on the top and bottom)
  * ASIN or FNSKU included
  * Product name included
  * Item condition included

**Note:** Amazon barcodes that have been printed directly onto the product
packaging must also meet these requirements.

If you are the product manufacturer or Intellectual Property owner and you
want to print barcodes directly onto the product packaging, apply for your own
[GS1 standard UPC barcode](https://www.gs1.org/).

## Print Amazon barcodes

You can print Amazon barcodes for your products from the **Label products**
page when you create a shipment, or at any time from [Manage
Inventory](/hz/inventory/).

Amazon barcode labels will be printed immediately if you use a thermal
printer. For laser printers, a PDF is generated that you can use to print
labels with standard label paper.

In the Send to Amazon workflow, if your SKU requires Amazon barcodes (FNSKU
labels) and you selected **Seller** as the labeling owner, click **Print SKU
labels** in the **Information/action** column, and then apply the printed
labels. You can also print all of the unit labels for a shipment by clicking
**Print all SKU labels** at the end of step 1.

Unit labels can also be printed from **View contents** in each shipment card
in steps 2 to 5 of the workflow.

When printing unit labels, you can choose standard formats or thermal printing
format in the label printing pop-ups.

To print Amazon barcodes from [Manage Inventory](/hz/inventory/), follow these
steps:

  1. Select the products in the left column.

  2. Select **Print item labels** from the **Action on selected** drop-down menu.

**Note:** The language of the item condition on your Amazon barcodes will be
translated to match your Seller Central language preference. Your product name
will not be translated.

## Label placement requirements

When you are ready to place barcodes on your products, make sure that you do
the following:

  * Put the correct barcode on each item.
  * Cover all other visible barcodes, except for any serial number barcodes or [Transparency authentication code](https://brandservices.amazon.com/transparency) labels.
  * Make sure the barcode is scannable after applying any prep materials.
  * Do not place the barcode on a curve or corner of the package.
  * Allow 0.25 inch between the edge of the label and the edge of the packaging.
  * Ensure that each item in a case pack has an Amazon barcode and that any barcodes on the case have been removed.

**Important:** Failure to follow label placement requirements can cause delays
in processing and may result in unplanned prep service fees.

## Printer requirements

The tools in your seller account are optimized for thermal printers. You can
also use laser printers. Do not use inkjet printers to print Amazon barcodes.

**Tip:** Amazon fulfillment centers currently use Zebra GX430t model printers
with a direct thermal setting.

Each label must be readable and scannable for 24 months. The following
guidelines will help ensure that the label you print will not smudge or fade:

  * Periodically test your Amazon barcodes by scanning them.
  * Use a printer with a print resolution of 300 dots per inch or greater.
  * Periodically test, clean, and replace your printer heads.

## Label paper requirements

All Amazon barcodes must be printed in black ink on white, non-reflective
labels with removable adhesive. Dimensions must be between 1 x 2 inches and 2
x 3 inches (1 x 3 inches or 2 x 2 inches, for example).

For laser printers, the tools in your seller account support the following
label sizes:

  * 21 labels per page (63.5 mm x 38.1 mm on A4)
  * 24 labels per page (63.5 mm x 33.9 mm on A4, 63.5 mm x 38.1 mm on A4, 64.6 mm x 33.8 mm on A4, 66.0 mm x 33.9 mm on A4, 70.0 mm x 36.0 mm on A4, 70.0 mm x 37.0 mm on A4)
  * 27 labels per page (63.5 mm x 29.6 mm on A4)
  * 30 labels per page (1 inch x 2 5/8 inches on US letter)
  * 40 labels per page (52.5 mm x 29.7 mm on A4)
  * 44 labels per page (48.5 mm x 25.4 mm on A4) 

If your printer attempts to scale the PDF print area when you print your
labels, make sure that the printer scaling is set to **None** or **100%**.

##  Common problems to avoid
