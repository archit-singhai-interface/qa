Handling returns and refunds efficiently is crucial for maintaining buyer
satisfaction and your account health as an Amazon seller.

**Processing return requests**  

  1. From the drop-down menu in Seller Central, select **Orders** and then select **Manage returns**.
  2. On [Manage Returns](/gp/returns/list/v2/ref=xx_myr_dnav_xx?mons_redirect=stck_reroute), you can review, authorize, or complete your return requests. You can also contact the buyer, issue full or partial refunds, and offer concessions against the return requests. 

For more information, go to [Manage seller-fulfilled
returns](/help/hub/reference/G200708210).

**Return shipping address**

Make sure that you have a valid default return address set up in your [return
settings](/gp/returns/settings/) to avoid undeliverable returns. To learn
more, go to [Return address settings](/help/hub/reference/G201711720).

For seller-fulfilled return requests sent through our [prepaid return
label](/help/hub/reference/G202072200) program, please note the following:

  * Undeliverable returns due to an outdated or incorrect return address that you have provided will be deemed abandoned, and we may dispose of them as appropriate, for example, by selling, recycling, or donating.
  * We may notify you to correct your address.
  * Continued use of an incorrect address may result in you not being able to sell on Amazon. 

When you receive a return shipment at your facility, the shipment will include
a packing slip and return mailing authorization number to help you identify
the return.

**Non-returnable items**

Some items [can't be
returned](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GMZNGRA9B5PCJB5F)
but may qualify for refunds or replacements if they were delivered damaged or
defective to the buyer. For non-returnable items, do the following:

  * Verify the item's returnability status on the product detail page.
  * Process returnless refunds or replacements when appropriate.

**Note:** Buyers cannot initiate return requests for non-returnable items
through the online returns center.

## Types of refunds

Buyer refunds are an important aspect of selling on Amazon. There are two main
types of refunds:

  * **Seller-issued refunds** : As a seller, you have control over issuing refunds in certain situations. We recommend that you receive and examine returned items before you issue a refund. 
  * **Amazon-issued refunds** : We may issue refunds in various situations to protect the buyer experience.

For more information, go to [Refund options](/help/hub/reference/G201725630).

## Order cancellations

If a buyer asks you to cancel an order, you have the following options based
on whether the order has been shipped:

  * **Unshipped orders** : Cancel the order on [Manage Orders](/orders-v3/) or use an order cancellation feed.
  * **Shipped orders** : Ask the buyer to initiate a return request for the order. You can authorize the return, if needed, on [Manage Returns](/gp/returns/list).

For more information, go to [Order
cancellations](/help/hub/reference/G201722390) and [Cancel multiple orders
with the order cancellation template](/help/hub/reference/G201576510).

## Reimbursement claims

Amazon has various buyer and seller reimbursement claim programs:

  * **A-to-z Guarantee claims** : This program protects buyers for timely delivery, item condition, and return experience for seller-fulfilled orders. If buyers are unsatisfied and canâ€™t reach a resolution with you, we enable them to file a reimbursement claim with us. For more information, go to [A-to-z Guarantee](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201889250).
  * **SAFE-T reimbursement claims** : The Seller Assurance for E-Commerce Transactions (SAFE-T) program allows you to request compensation from Amazon after a refund is deducted from your account and issued to the buyer. When we issue a refund to a buyer and you believe you are not at fault, you can file a claim for reimbursement via SAFE-T. For more information, go to [Reimbursement for seller-fulfilled network prepaid returns](/help/hub/reference/G202175000). 
  * **Chargeback claims** : A chargeback, also known as a charge dispute, occurs when a cardholder contacts their bank to dispute the charge for an order placed on Amazon. In such cases, you have the option to present your case. For more information, go to [Respond to a chargeback claim](/help/hub/reference/G202145040).
  * **Lost or damaged in transit claims** : If an order is returned damaged and you believe the damage was related to the carrier, you can use the [optional coverage for loss or damage](/help/hub/reference/G200204080) process to file a claim.
