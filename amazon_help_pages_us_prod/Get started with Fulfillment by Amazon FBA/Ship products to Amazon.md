This page provides information on the options that you can use to create a
shipping plan for sending inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers.

**Note:** To send inventory to Amazon for fulfillment, you must change the
fulfillment method to Fulfilled by Amazon. For more information, go to [List
products for Fulfillment by Amazon](/gp/help/G200141220).

You can send your inventory to Amazon by creating a shipping plan, packing
your products, and sending them to the fulfillment centers that Amazon
designates, using the carrier of your choice.Inventory that is sent to a
fulfillment center is usually scanned and made available for sale within three
business days of delivery.

Options for creating a shipment include the following:

[Send to Amazon](/gp/help/G6925SDD66GDLXJW) | A streamlined shipment creation workflow with simplified steps that saves you time when you replenish inventory. Create your shipments either by adding products from the Send to Amazon page or by uploading the list of products using an Excel spreadsheet. [Get started with Send to Amazon](/fba/sendtoamazon/confirm_content_step).

[The Amazon Partnered Carrier Program](/gp/help/G201119120) | An Amazon Partnered Carrier will come to pick up your inventory from a nominated pick-up address (that is, your home or warehouse) in an eligible AU postcode and deliver your shipment to a designated Amazon fulfillment center.   
[Send/replenish inventory](/gp/help/201021820) | This shipment creation workflow is being replaced by Send to Amazon. Starting October 17, 2022, all new FBA shipments must be created either in Send to Amazon or with Amazon Marketplace Web Service or Selling Partner APIs. To learn more, go to [FBA shipment creation changes to Send to Amazon](/gp/help/GF3FZUPP7UZ34AZY).  
  
Send your products to the locations that Amazon designates for your shipping
plan. This ensures that your inventory is placed closer to customers and
reduces the order delivery time for your products.

Not shipping your products as stated in your approved shipping plan (for
example, by canceling part of an approved shipping plan, misrouting a
shipment, or sending an incomplete shipment) is not permitted. It leads to
additional processing and handling that can delay receipt of your inventory
and its availability for sale. This may also result in blocking of your
shipment creation abilities.

**Note:** A fee for unplanned prep services will be charged for units that
require labels that are received with the barcode label missing. Go to
[Unplanned services](/gp/help/G201000230) for more information. Planned prep
or labeling, as part of the [FBA Prep Service](/gp/help/G201023020) or [FBA
Label Service](/gp/help/G200483750), might delay full receipt of your
shipment. However, unplanned prep or prep that is not part of the FBA prep or
label services might further delay complete receipt of your deliveries by up
to 48 hours.

For more information about the FBA shipment policy and the actions that we may
take if your shipments are not compliant with that policy, go to [Deleted,
misrouted, and incomplete shipments](/gp/help/GLMEBQLNBY97ANYY).
