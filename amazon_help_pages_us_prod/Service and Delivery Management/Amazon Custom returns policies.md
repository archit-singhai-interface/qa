Amazon requires sellers to have return policies that are at least as favorable
as the Amazon returns policy.

If you use Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP), you must adhere to the return
policies of SFP. If you feel that you meet the criteria to not accept a return
please see: [File a reimbursement (SAFE-T) claim](/gp/help/202109110).

If you are not part of SFP, locate the customer return policy for customizable
products on the [About Our Returns
Policies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=15015721)
page, under the heading “Handmade at Amazon and Customizable Products.”
