[Before you submit a claim](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GL862UFSVUR6TM2P#mnd_2jc_jcb__section_uvx_mtf_tsb)

This page applies to unused labels for partnered carrier shipments.

Non-partnered carrier shipments are ineligible for unused shipping label refunds.

The process to a file a claim varies according to where in the fulfillment process your item was lost or damaged:

-   Shipment to Amazon
-   Fulfillment center operations
-   FBA customer returns
-   Removals

## Claim window

You must submit your claim within nine months of the shipment creation date. Claims submitted outside of this window are not eligible for reimbursement.

## Before you submit a claim

-   Confirm that the shipment is canceled or closed.
-   Check your Reimbursements report to see if you have already been reimbursed for the unused labels.

## Submit your claim

After reviewing your Reimbursements report, if you still believe an unused label is eligible for reimbursement, you can file a claim. To submit a claim on unused labels, open a claim through the ‘Get support’ page in Seller Central.

Once we complete our investigation of your claim, we will confirm if it is eligible for reimbursement.

**Note:** You may file only one claim per shipment. Additional claims for the same shipment will be declined.
