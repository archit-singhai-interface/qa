To maintain enrollment in Seller Fulfilled Prime, you must continuously
satisfy the [Seller Fulfilled Prime program policy](/gp/help/G201812300).
Performance requirements are monitored and enforced weekly against the minimum
performance thresholds. For more information, go to [Seller Fulfilled Prime
performance requirements](/gp/help/G202072550).

## Performance monitoring process

Your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance will be reviewed on a weekly basis,
from Sunday through Saturday.

The first time that you don't meet a requirement, you'll get an email notice.

If you don't meet that same requirement a second time, you'll get an email
notice, and Prime offers will be disabled for your account. You can re-enable
Prime offers at your discretion, but we recommend that you do so only after
you address the root cause of the performance issue.

If you don't meet the requirement for a third time, you'll get an email notice
and your enrollment will be revoked. Prime offers will be disabled for all
Prime shipping templates and your program status will change from “Enrolled”
to “Not enrolled.”

Later, if you pre-qualify for the program's 30-day trial period, you can start
the trial. If you meet all requirements and pass the trial, you'll be re-
enrolled into the program.

## Eligibility reset

If you have met a requirement for four consecutive weeks following your first
or second infraction, your eligibility status for that requirement will be
reset.

## Unenroll from Seller Fulfilled Prime

To unenroll from the program, first disable Prime offers to prevent any
undesired orders:

  1. From the settings menu in Seller Central, select **Shipping settings**.

  2. Select **General shipping settings**.

  3. In the **Premium shipping programs** section, select **Control Prime order volume**.

  4. In the **Enable/Disable Prime** section, set to **Prime offers disabled**.

Then, reach out to Selling Partner Support to request that your account be
removed from the program. Your program status will change from “Enrolled” to
“Not enrolled.”
