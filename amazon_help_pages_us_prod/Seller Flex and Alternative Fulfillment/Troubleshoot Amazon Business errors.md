##  Warning 95030

If you set a Quantity Discount greater than 50% off the business price, you
will see this warning, but your discount will still be accepted. High
discounts are not against policy. The warning exists simply to alert sellers
who may have set the high discount by mistake.

##  Additional errors

You will receive additional errors if any of the following are true:

  * You enter a Business Price that is higher than your regular price.
  * Your quantity prices increase with larger orders instead of decrease.
  * You provide a **minimum-seller-allowed-price** , but then set a **business-price** or **quantity-price** lower than that **minimum-seller-allowed-price**.
