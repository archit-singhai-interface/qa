A chargeback, also known as a charge dispute, occurs when a cardholder
contacts their bank to dispute the charge for an order placed on Amazon. A
chargeback can be filed for a variety of reasons, ranging from non-receipt of
the product to unauthorized use of the credit card.

**Note:** If you are an Amazon Pay seller, please use the information on
[Handling chargebacks](/gp/help/201115880) page instead.

As outlined in our [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/help/1791):

  * You are responsible for chargebacks filed against your account for service-related reasons, such as non-receipt of the product.
  * Amazon is responsible for any payment-related fraud chargebacks, such as stolen credit cards or other payment fraud attempts.

To prevent chargeback claims, follow these best practices:

  * Use the shipping address provided to you by Amazon. You are liable for any disputes filed for orders you send to a different shipping address.
  * Use a shipping method with a valid tracking number.
  * Use delivery confirmation (signature required) for high value merchandise.
  * Keep a record of the date the order was shipped, the shipping method used, and any available tracking information for at least 6 months after the order date.
