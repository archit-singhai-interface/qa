Customer safety is of paramount importance to Amazon. We aim to ensure that
customers can be confident in finding a comprehensive selection of relevant
products from sellers without having to worry about product safety, quality,
or reliability. We also aim to ensure that each qualified seller can offer the
appropriate products for sale, with real-time approval to sell.

As a seller, it is important that you understand and comply with Amazon's
guidelines and policies on product safety and compliance. This could help
increase your chances of succeeding as a seller on Amazon, as well as help you
avoid practices that could lead to blocked listings, or even prevent you from
selling on Amazon. To learn more about the consequences for violations, go to

Our goal is to make compliance easy for you. The Manage your compliance (MYC)
dashboard makes it easy for you to add compliance documents and information or
appeal requests. Compliance services to assist you with testing (Lab Central)
are available on the Service Provider Network (SPN).

process for selling products that have safety and compliance requirements.
