Buyers can leave feedback for sellers on orders that are fulfilled by Amazon
just as they do for merchant-fulfilled orders. The [Feedback
Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/feedback-manager/index.html#/) on
the **Performance** tab lets you track buyer satisfaction with your service.
You can view short-term and long-term metrics as well as detailed feedback
entries with buyer comments and email addresses.

#### What happens when I receive a negative feedback on an AFN order?

When a buyer leaves negative feedback that is related to delivery service
provided by Amazon, you can request for [removal of the
feedback](/gp/help/GSVLUKGSWX9EEM9N). After reviewing the feedback, we might
strike through the negative rating, and it will not reflect on your
performance metrics. The buyer's comment will remain with a note from Amazon
that states, "This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility
for this fulfillment experience."

However, if we find that any portion of the comment applies to the condition
of your product as indicated on your listing (New, Used, etc.), or any service
that you, instead of Amazon, provided or arranged to be provided to the buyer,
the feedback and negative rating will remain without edits.

Please note that our policies prohibit any activity that would interfere with
our capacity to help other sellers, including submission of high volumes of
incorrect or speculative requests to Seller Support.

**Note:** The buyer feedback strike-through only applies to items sold on
Amazon and fulfilled through the Amazon fulfillment network (AFN). A merchant-
fulfilled order on Amazon, even if submitted as a Multi-Channel Fulfillment
order, is not eligible for buyer feedback strike-through.
