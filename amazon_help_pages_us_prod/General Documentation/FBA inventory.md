**Important:** If you have a North America Unified Account and if you list
products on Amazon.com, Amazon.ca, or Amazon.com.mx, products listed for sale
in those stores must be sent to a fulfillment center in the respective
country. To create shipments for different North American stores, select the
store from the drop-down menu at the top right of Seller Central before you
create your shipment. For information about selling across North American
borders, go to [Important information for international
sellers](/gp/help/200404870).

Use the tools in your seller account to list products, create shipping plans,
send in shipments, track and monitor your shipments, and remove inventory from
Amazon fulfillment centers.

## Send inventory to Amazon

**Note:** Once your inventory is received at a fulfillment center or receive
center, it is available for sale. You can track the status of your shipment in
the Shipping Queue as it changes from **In transit** to **Delivered** ,
**Checked in** , **Receiving** , and **Closed**. To learn more, go to [How
Amazon receives and stores your inventory](/gp/help/G201081250).

Options for creating shipments include the following:

  * [Send to Amazon](/gp/help/G6925SDD66GDLXJW): A streamlined shipment creation workflow with simplified steps that saves you time when you replenish inventory. Create your shipments either by adding products from the [Send to Amazon](/fba/sendtoamazon/confirm_content_step) page or by uploading the list of products using an Excel spreadsheet.
  * [Send/replenish inventory to Amazon](/gp/help/201021820): This shipment creation workflow is being replaced by Send to Amazon.

For a quick introduction to the shipment creation process, watch the Seller
University video series beginning with [How FBA
works](/learn/courses?courseId=8&moduleId=38).

**Note:** By default, when you create a workflow, your inventory may be
divided into multiple shipments, each directed to a different fulfillment
center. The fulfillment centers are selected based on the products you're
shipping and where you're shipping them from. With your inventory spread
across multiple fulfillment centers across the country, customers who buy your
products can get them delivered faster than they would if your inventory was
located farther away.
