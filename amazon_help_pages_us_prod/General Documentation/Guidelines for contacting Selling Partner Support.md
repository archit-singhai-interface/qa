We strive to provide quick and accurate support to resolve questions about
selling on Amazon through [Contact us](/cu/contact-
us?_encoding=UTF8&ref_=ag_contactus_nmhb_521). To help us better serve you,
follow these guidelines:

  * Review your case log and check the case status instead of opening a new case. If your issue is time-sensitive, flag the case as **Urgent**.
  * Create one case per issue. We have multiple teams and they will resolve your issue more efficiently if each team receives their own contact on a specific issue.
  * Don’t open a new case if one is already under review for the same issue.
  * If you need more time to respond to a case, you can ask us to keep the case open.
  * If you have questions about a closed case or think it was handled incorrectly, reopen it instead of opening a new case.
  * Do not reopen a case or raise it as a new case if we have informed you that no further action will be taken on it.

**Note:** To protect sellers and customers, we decline requests that are not
consistent with our policies. We may close a case if you don’t follow these
guidelines.
