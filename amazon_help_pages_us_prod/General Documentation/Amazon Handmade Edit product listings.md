You can modify details in your product listings, including general
information, images, additional information, and customization, either one at
a time using the [Manage Inventory](/myi/search/DefaultView.amzn) tool in your
seller account, or through an inventory file upload.  
  
To edit product details or listing information one at a time, follow these
steps:  

  1. Go to the **Inventory** tab and click [Manage Inventory](/inventory).
  2. Find the listing you want to edit.
  3. You can make quick changes such as inventory levels in the **Available** column (for Fulfilled by Merchant items) or **Price** directly.
  4. For other edits, click **Edit** button (located by default on the far right). This will display the detail page for your product. From here, you can select one of the available tabs (**Vital Info** , **Variations** , **Offer** , **Images** etc.) to edit the details of your product.

To change more than one product at a time through an inventory file upload,
follow these steps:  

  1. In Seller Central, download an [Inventory Template](/listing/download?ref_=xx_download_tnav_upload).
  2. Once the template is generated, enter the relevant SKUs and the values you want to edit.
  3. Under the “update_delete” attribute, select the option you wish to use based on your intentions:
     * **Delete** : removes product
     * **PartialUpdate** : all specified information overwrites any existing information but unspecified info (that is, blank attribute fields) is unaffected.
     * **Update (full)** : this option overwrites all existing product attributes, blank attribute cells will erase any existing information.
  4. Save and upload the file with the edits in the **Upload your Inventory File** tab.

If you want to use already-existing information and copy and paste it to the
Inventory Template for quick changes, follow these steps:  

  1. Hover over **Inventory** and click **Inventory Reports**.
  2. Select the type of report you want to download, **All Listings Report** is recommended (more information about each report will be displayed when you select it on the dropdown menu). This downloads a .txt (Notepad) file. 
  3. Copy the information from this file and paste it to an Excel sheet for easier access to the attributes. 
  4. Copy all attributes needed and paste into the inventory template downloaded, and then upload the template to Seller Central according to the steps described above.
