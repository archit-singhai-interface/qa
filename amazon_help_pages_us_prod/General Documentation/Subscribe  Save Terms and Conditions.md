These terms and conditions supplement the [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/help/G47071) and govern your participation in the Subscribe &
Save program (the "Program").

#### 1\. Seller eligibility

You must meet the eligibility requirements described in the [Program help
page](/gp/help/G201620110) to participate in the Program.

#### 2\. Product enrollment, availability, and withdrawal

(a) Amazon may, but is not obligated to, enroll Your Products in the Program
if they are eligible. Either You or Amazon may cancel the enrollment of Your
Products in the Program at any time.

(b) Only products that meet the eligibility requirements in the [Program help
page](/gp/help/G201620110) may be enrolled in the Program.

(c) If you offer a product through the Program, you will also offer that
product on Amazon to customers who do not use Subscribe & Save.

#### 3\. Customer discounts and pricing

(a) You agree to fund any additional discount for customer subscriptions on
products offered in the Program beyond any discounts provided by Amazon by the
amount in the [Program help page](/gp/help/G201620110). Amazon may choose to
offer customers an additional discount on any product offered through the
Program. These discounts will be applied to the price of Your Product at the
time of the order.

(b) You may combine discounts associated with other Amazon programs and
promotional discounts you offer on Your Products. These discounts will be
added to the applicable Program discount for each of Your Products.

#### 4\. Order fulfillment and cancellation

Customer orders for Subscribe & Save products may be allocated at Amazon's
discretion to one or more sellers. Your participation in the Program does not
guarantee that any Subscribe & Save order will be placed with you. Customers
may cancel Subscribe & Save subscriptions at any time.
