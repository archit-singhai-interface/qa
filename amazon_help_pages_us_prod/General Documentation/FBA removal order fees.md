## Values used to calculate fee

**Product size tier** | Product size tiers are measurement categories based on the unit weight, product dimensions, and dimensional weight of a packaged item. Learn how to [determine your product-size tier](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W), or use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/gp/ssof/reports/search.html?recordType=STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES&language=en_US&ref=au_fbafulrpts_cont_9W7FVTLY343ZBKN) to see the size tier information for products you have previously stored in FBA.

**Shipping weight** | Shipping weight is the item weight to ship an order of the item. The shipping weight is calculated based on the itemâ€™s unit weight or dimensional weight, depending on size tier and whichever is greater. Learn how to [determine your product's shipping weight](/gp/help/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY).  
  
## Rate cards

Use the size tier of your product to determine which rate card applies. If
your product requires special handling*, then use the **Oversize and special
handling items** rate card.

**Note:** Shipping weight in the standard-size tiers under 1 lb is calculated
by rounding up to the nearest 0.1 lb. For the remaining size tiers, the
shipping weight is calculated by rounding up to the nearest whole pound.

Size tier | Shipping weight | Removal fee per unit  
---|---|---  
**Standard size** | 0 to 0.5 lb | $1.04  
0.5+ to 1.0 lb | $1.53  
1.0+ to 2.0 lb | $2.27  
More than 2 lb | $2.89 + $1.06/lb above 2 lb
