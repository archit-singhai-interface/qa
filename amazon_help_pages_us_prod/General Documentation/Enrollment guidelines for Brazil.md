Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions below so that you can easily
find the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, search for your trademark by going to [Instituto Nacional da
Propriedade Industrial
(INPIBR)](https://busca.inpi.gov.br/pePI/jsp/marcas/Pesquisa_num_processo.jsp)
and following the steps below:  

  1. Sign in to your account.
  2. Enter your trademark number to the search field. 
  3. Click **Pesquisar**.
  4. Under **N****ú****mero** , click the hyperlink of the trademark number.

## Brand name

Confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name under **Marca**. Then,
in the **What is your brand name?** field of the Brand Registry application,
enter the trademark name exactly as it appears on INPIBR.

## Trademark office

In the **Select a trademark office** field of the Brand Registry application,
select **Brazil – Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial – INPIBR**.

## Process number

To find your trademark’s process on INIBR, review the information under **Nº
do Processo**. Then, enter this number in the **Please enter the process
number** field of the Brand Registry application.

**_WIPO number_**

If you’re applying with a trademark that was issued by the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) with designation in Brazil, enter the **Process
number** on **INPIBR**. Do not enter your WIPO number into your Brand Registry
application.

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from Brazil that are either registered or pending
registration.

To find the status of your trademark on INPIBR, review the details under
**Situação**.

Then, locate this status in the table below to understand if your trademark is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. In the **What is the
current status of your trademark?** field of the Brand Registry application,
select the appropriate status.

Status on INPIBR | Status to select in application  
---|---  
Registro Registro de marca em vigor Alto Renome, Reg. c/PAN (Registered with pending administrative nullity proceeding) | Registered  
Arquivado Aguardando Aguardando fim de sobrestamento Para liberar para exame de mérito Pedido em exame de recurso Aguardando prazo de apresentação de oposição Aguardando pagamento da concessão (em prazo ordinário) Aguardando apresentação e exame de recurso contra o indeferimento Aguardando exame de mérito Aguardando exame de petição de prorrogação (registro de marca em vigor) | Pending  
  
**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

To find your trademark’s type, review the information under **Apresentação**.

If you see "Nominativa", your trademark is a text-based mark (word mark). If
you see "Mista", your trademark is an image-based mark (design mark).

Then, select the trademark type under the **Select the trademark type**
section of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark type trademarks are eligible for
initial enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to
your account once you’ve enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your brand](/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
