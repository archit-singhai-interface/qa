This Subscribe with Amazon Policy supplements and modifies the [Amazon
Services Business Solutions Agreement](/gp/help/1791) (the “Agreement”) and
applies only to products enrolled in the Subscribe with Amazon program
(“SwA”). SwA is a Service that enables sellers to offer physical subscription
boxes.

## Program requirements

Amazon must approve your SwA profile content, including any questions aimed at
customization, prior to such content’s usage on Amazon sites. Data regarding
customer product preferences and customization will be subject to the same
restrictions and controls as personal information under the Agreement.

## Subscription box requirements

If your subscription box contains items that you make available for individual
sale, the price of the box must be less than the aggregate of the lowest price
for each of the constituent items on Your Sales Channels.

If you would like to make a price change to your subscription, you must
provide Amazon with thirty (30) days’ prior notice before such change takes
effect.

Each calendar-based subscription box must be shipped no later than the
earliest subscription box shipment date offered through Your Sales Channels.

Notwithstanding Section 11 in the Agreement, you may include product shipping
inserts in your subscription box, provided that the communications primarily
promote or advertise you or products sold by you on Amazon and don’t seek to
influence a customer to purchase any of Your Products via an alternative sales
channel, including Your Sales Channels.
