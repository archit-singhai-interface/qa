You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including the
warning requirements mandated by California’s Proposition 65 (Prop 65). For
all existing and new product listings, you must:

  * Determine if the product needs a Prop 65 warning.
  * Provide Amazon with the correct Prop 65 warning using the instructions on this page (and not in any other way, such as by email).
  * Contact Selling Partner Support if a court requires you to provide a custom Prop 65 warning for your product.
  * Provide us with the Prop 65 warning you received from the manufacturer of the product, if you are not the manufacturer of the product you are listing, or from anyone else that sold or transferred the product to you.
  * Not provide us with any warning materials such as labels, labeling, shelf signs, or tags to display with your product unless we otherwise instruct you to do so in writing.
  * Provide Prop 65 warnings for any applicable child SKUs. If you provide a Prop 65 warning on a parent SKU, you will receive an error message and the submission will fail.

**Note:** If you received an email from Amazon Product Compliance asking you
to update certain listings, please follow the instructions included in the
email. If your listings do not require a warning, no further action is
required from you.

**Note:** You are responsible for adding a Prop 65 warning to the products you
sell in Amazon’s store even if you have fewer than 10 employees, and even if
someone else is selling the same product.

## More information on Prop 65

Proposition 65, officially the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act
of 1986, is a California law that requires warnings be provided to California
consumers when they will be exposed to chemicals identified by California as
causing cancer or reproductive toxicity. The warnings are intended to help
California consumers make informed decisions about their exposures to these
chemicals from the products they use. The California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) administers the Proposition 65 program and
publishes the listed chemicals, which includes more than 850 chemicals. In
August 2016, OEHHA adopted new regulations, effective on August 30, 2018,
which change the information required in Proposition 65 warnings.

## How to provide Prop 65 warnings for your new and existing products

Use the methods below to provide Prop 65 warnings when creating single or
multiple listings in Seller Central.

When creating a single listing in Seller Central:  

  1. Go to **Inventory** and select **Add a Product**.
  2. Click **Create a new product listing**.
  3. Go to the **Compliance** tab and select the appropriate California Proposition 65 Warning Type and, if needed, the associated California Proposition 65 Chemical Name(s). See the table below for the Warning Types and an explanation of the warning that will be displayed with each Warning Type.

**Creating multiple listings in Seller Central**  

  1. Go to **Inventory** and select **Add Products via Upload**.
  2. Select the applicable product classifications and generate an advanced template.
  3. In the template, you will find the California Proposition 65 attributes under the **Compliance** group. Select the appropriate California Proposition 65 Warning Type and, if applicable, the associated California Proposition 65 Chemical Name(s).

**Important:** If you use custom feeds to create your listings, you must
supplement those listings' information and use either method above to add Prop
65 warning information.
