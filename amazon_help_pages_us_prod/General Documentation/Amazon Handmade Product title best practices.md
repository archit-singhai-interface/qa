Review your product titles to ensure your customers can search and easily find
your products. Titles should be clear and succinct. Use short and simple words
that describe the product as product titles. For details on how to edit your
product titles, see [Amazon Handmade: Edit product
listings](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/GACPFCRX6CH32JST?language=en_US&ref=su_GACPFCRX6CH32JST_cont_GRLUNACJV3JB23G2).

## Title best practices

  * Use enough descriptive words to provide a complete idea of the product. For example, a well-optimized title for search is “Personalized brown ceramic 12oz coffee mug.” It covers all the product specifics in as few words as possible without going into the details.
  * 60 characters or less is recommended.
  * When adding additional detail such as color, print, or description of the product, make it specific to the product rather than a general or a broad title.
  * Add Handmade or Handcrafted to the title so customers know this is a unique item made by hand.
  * You don’t need to add a lot of additional words to the title, rather add these in the section **Search Terms**. The Amazon search engine will include both your title and search terms automatically, so no need to replicate.

## Good title examples

  * Sterling Silver Cactus Stud Earrings
  * Handmade Rose Gold Bar Earrings - Rose Gold Stud Earrings -Tiny Bar Studs Simple Bar Studs
  * Personalized Bangle Bracelet Birthstone Names
  * Personalized Gift 8oz Scented Candle - Custom gift ready to ship within 3 days, made with 100% Natural Soy Wax.
  * Murwall Floral Peonies Wall Decal, Peony Bouquet Flowers Removable Peel and Stick Wall Sticker

## Product titles to avoid

  * Avoid titles that are too long and detailed. Instead, add keywords to **Search Terms** instead of the title. Example: “Remember going to the beach as a kid? Photo frame with seashells – great mother’s day birthday best friends daughters sisters mom beach décor.”
  * Avoid titles that are too vague. Describe the product in enough detail so it does not sound vague or generic. Example: “USA Map Photo.”
