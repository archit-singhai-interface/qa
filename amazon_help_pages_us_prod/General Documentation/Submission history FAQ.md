Submission history is a log of your reports submitted through the [Report a
Violation](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/brand/report-a-violation) tool. To
access from it, click **Monitor** at the top of the page and select
**Submission history**. On this page, you can view the Submission summary
dashboard. Here you can sort submissions by brands, stores, or both and see
the status and ASIN count of all reports submitted for your brand through the
Report a Violation tool in the past six months. Rights owners can also view a
list of submitters who submitted reports with a status of “Not accepted.”

#### What is a report?

A report is a notice of suspected infringement that can be tracked using a
complaint ID. One report can include one or more ASINs.

#### What is a complaint ID?

A complaint ID is a unique identifier provided to track your report. One
complaint ID can include reports on multiple ASINs. For each ID, you can view
the reported ASIN or ASINs by clicking on the arrow below the complaint ID.

#### What types of reports or cases are shown on the Submission history page?

The Submission history page only shows reports submitted through the Report a
Violation tool and self-service counterfeit removals submitted through Project
Zero.
