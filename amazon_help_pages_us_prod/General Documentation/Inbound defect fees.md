Amazon may refuse shipments that don’t comply with FBA shipment requirements.
If we accept inventory that does not meet our shipment requirements or differs
from your shipping plan, you may be charged inbound defect fees for the
additional cost required to re-direct, receive, and process your shipment.

Inbound defect fees may be incurred for the following problems:

  * **Shipments delivered to the wrong location:** Your shipment was sent to a different fulfillment center than the one listed in your shipping plan.
  * **Deleted and abandoned shipments:** Your domestic shipments didn’t arrive within 45 days of shipment creation and your international shipments didn’t arrive within 75 days of shipment creation. In a multiple destination shipping plan, your additional shipments didn’t arrive within 30 days of the first shipment arrival.

For more information on the problem types, go to [Deleted, misrouted, and
incomplete shipments](/gp/help/GLMEBQLNBY97ANYY).

The following table outlines the per-unit inbound defect fees amount.

**Product size tier 1** | **Weight** | **Inbound defect fees amount**  
---|---|---  
**Shipments delivered to the wrong location** | **Deleted and abandoned shipments**  
**Small standard** **Max 15 x 12 x 0.75 inches** | 16 oz or less | $0.04 | $0.02  
**Large standard** **Max 18 x 14 x 8 inches** | 12 or less oz | $0.04 | $0.02  
12+ oz to 1.5 lb | $0.05 | $0.02  
1.5+ lb to 3 lb | $0.06 | $0.03

**How to avoid inbound defect fees**

To avoid inbound defect fees and ensure that your inventory is received and
processed quickly, you must follow the [FBA Program Policies](/gp/help/G521),
the [Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement](/gp/help/G1791) and our
[Packaging and prep requirements](/gp/help/G200141500). An accurate FBA
shipping plan can reduce lost and damaged inventory, customer complaints, and
returns.

**How to dispute inbound defect fees**

If you believe you were issued inbound defect fees in error, you can request
an investigation of the inbound defect fees if you submit your request within
30 days of the shipment problem notification. For more information on inbound
defect fees disputes, go to [Resolve inbound performance
issues](/gp/help/G3FFQ2AHWU69GTDW).
