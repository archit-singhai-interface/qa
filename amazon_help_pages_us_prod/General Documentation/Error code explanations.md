Errors result when you submit a product that does not comply with the [Product
Detail Page Rules](/gp/help/G200390640). These error messages are safeguards
that prevent incorrect information in your product from being displayed on the
website.

The errors could be caused by multiple reasons, such as:

  * Using an incorrect template
  * Not adding mandatory or required attributes in the template
  * Adding incorrect attributes that:
    * Do not match with the valid attribute values
    * Contradict other attributes or related attributes
    * Exceed the character limit

For example, if you submit a product with a description that exceeds 1000
characters, this will result in an error in the [processing
report](/gp/help/G200194300), and your product will not be included in the
catalog.

We encourage you to review the [processing report](/gp/help/201576740) after
each upload. If you are submitting an inventory file, this report shows up in
[Check Upload Status](/product-search/bulk/status).

To see error messages, their definitions and suggested solutions, select an
error from the list on the left side of the navigation.
