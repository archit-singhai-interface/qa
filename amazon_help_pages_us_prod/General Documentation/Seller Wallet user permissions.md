## Designate point of contact for Seller Wallet

The point of contact is the primary user that you registered for your seller
account. The same point of contact is used for your Seller Wallet account.

To change the point of contact name for your seller account and Seller Wallet
account, select **Account info** under the **Settings** drop-down menu. On
this page, you can change your current point of contact name to a different
point of contact.

Once the new point of contact is verified, they will become the primary user
of your seller account and Seller Wallet account.

## Allow authorized users to access Seller Wallet

Your Seller Wallet account can have a primary user (also called point of
contact) and authorized users.

Seller Wallet is only visible to authorized users who have been verified by
Amazon. If you do not have permissions, the primary account holder for your
account can initiate a verification request and then grant permissions to you
once your verification is approved.

The primary account holder is the person who initially registered with Amazon.
Primary account holders can grant permissions for authorized users by going to
the **Settings** drop-down menu and selecting **User permissions**.

On this page, you can add a user or select an existing user and click **Edit**
to change their permissions. Scroll down to the Seller Wallet section and
locate **Manage transactions**. If the permissions cannot be assigned, primary
account holders can use the link below **Manage transactions** to start the
authorized user verification.

For more information, go to [Set and edit user permissions](/gp/help/G901).

There are three levels of Seller Wallet permissions:

  * **None:** These users do not have access to Seller Wallet.
  * **View:** These users can access Seller Wallet and review transaction history, but cannot make fund transfers or download statements.
  * **View and edit:** These users can access Seller Wallet, make fund transfers, and download statements.

Make sure that you grant view and edit permissions only to users who are
authorized to make transfers in Seller Wallet.
