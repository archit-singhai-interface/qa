To help further increase your sales, you can make use of fee discounts, offer
gift options, and upload a video to the detail pages of your product.

By using fee discounts, you can offer popular products at more competitive
prices. There are three types of fee discounts that you can choose from:
price-related, selection-related, and Prime-related. Gift options, on the
other hand, enable you to offer buyers gift-wrapping, gift messaging, or both.
Lastly, adding a video to the detail page of your product might increase your
sales up to 9.7%. Before buyers make a purchasing decision, they want to see
products in action to better understand how their features work.

For more information on each of these options, visit their dedicated pages
from the left navigation panel.
