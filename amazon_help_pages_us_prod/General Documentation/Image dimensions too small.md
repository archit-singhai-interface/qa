An image will fail to upload if its longest side is smaller than 500 pixels.

To verify image size, right-click the image file and click **Properties**.

The optimal zoom experience for product detail pages requires files to be
1,000 pixels or larger on the longest side. Zoom has been shown to help
improve sales. If you are unable to meet this requirement, the smallest your
file can be for zoom is 500 pixels on the longest side.

Images must not exceed 10,000 pixels on the longest side.
