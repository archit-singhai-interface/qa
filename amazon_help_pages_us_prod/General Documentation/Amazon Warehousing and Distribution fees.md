To address our storage and operational costs, we charge three [fee
types](/gp/help/GPB467PZW3AZC4V3) for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution
(AWD): storage fees, processing fees, and transportation fees.

For each of these fee types, the following tiers apply through March 31, 2025:

  * **Base rate****:** If you use your own transportation or carrier service for shipments that are sent to AWD
  * **Integrated rate** : If you're using Amazon Global Logistics, Amazon Global Selling SEND, or the Partnered Carrier program as the upstream transportation or carrier service provider 

See the table below in the **Fee rates** section for updated information.

To be eligible for the integrated rate, you must send at least one shipment to
AWD by using another Amazon service (Amazon Global Logistics, Amazon Global
Selling SEND, or the Partnered Carrier program) in the previous four calendar
months.

Eligibility is assessed on the 25th of each month for the following month's
charges. For charges to be assessed in May, for example, we’ll confirm on
April 25 that you sent a qualifying shipment between January 1 and April 25
and that you’re eligible to receive the integrated rates in May.

**Effective April 1, 2025** , we’ll introduce a new smart storage rate and
discontinue the integrated rate. Starting on this date, the following AWD fee
tiers will apply:

  * **Base rate** : If you manually manage replenishment to our fulfillment centers
  * **Smart storage rate** : If you use AWD auto-replenishment to move inventory to fulfillment centers and maintain sufficient inventory levels across AWD and FBA

Once these new fee tiers take effect, a SKU will qualify for the smart storage
rate if 70% or more of that SKU inventory is sent to our fulfillment centers
through AWD auto-replenishment in the preceding 90 days, and if sufficient
inventory levels are maintained across AWD and Amazon’s fulfillment network
for the SKU. We’ll provide more details on the criteria for the smart storage
rate by January 15, 2025.

Also starting April 1, 2025, the AWD processing fee will be charged separately
at inbound when your inventory is received in our distribution center, and
again at outbound when a replenishment order is successfully delivered to
Amazon’s fulfillment network or your other sales channels.

Effective April 1, 2025, you can get 20% off AWD storage fees and 10% off AWD
transportation fees from AWD to FBA when you choose the Supply Chain by Amazon
Managed Service. For more information, go to [Amazon Managed
Service](/gp/help/G9U5H3ER7NUFNQJY).

**Note:** The updated AWD storage fee will first be reflected in your May 2025
charge for storage that’s used in April 2025. The updated AWD processing and
transportation fees will be applicable for replenishment orders confirmed on
or after April 1, 2025.

## Applicability of FBA fees

AWD automatically replenishes your inventory to FBA fulfillment centers based
on demand signals to help you maintain the right inventory levels. Therefore,
low-inventory-level and storage utilization fees don’t apply at an SKU level
when you auto-replenish 70% or more of that SKU to FBA through AWD over the
previous 90 days.

Starting April 1, 2025, there will be two changes to FBA fee applicability on
inventory replenished to Amazon's fulfillment network from AWD:

  * In addition to the FBA storage utilization fee and FBA low-inventory-level fee, the FBA aged inventory surcharge for products that are stored between 181-365 days in Amazon's fulfillment network will not apply to SKUs in which you auto-replenish 70% or more units to FBA through AWD over the previous 90 days.
  * The low-inventory-level fee will apply to SKUs in which you decide to set a maximum number of units limit for FBA inventory that should be maintained through auto-replenishment.
