Customizations are applied as added features on a standard product. Custom
listings must be compliant with standard [Amazon product listing
guidelines](/gp/help/G200316110) as well as the [program
terms](/gp/help/201823150).

Once registered as an Amazon Custom seller, you can enable customizations on
products through the standard listing experience.

**Note:** Since Amazon Custom is not a category, make sure that all of your
listings conform to the style guide for the specific product category. To
learn more, go to [Custom and category custom
templates](/gp/help/GPWDARLTJB2JNJ8R).

## Create a custom product listing

To get started, make sure that customization is enabled for your product:

  1. From the listing page, click the product details tab and select **Yes** for the question **Does your product have customization?**

  2. Enter your custom product details on the customization tab.

You can also access the customization listing page from Manage Inventory. From
the **Edit** drop-down menu for the product, select **Add/edit
customization**.

**Note:** If you don’t see this option, you may not be registered for the
program. To register, go to [Amazon Custom](/gp/help/201757520).

  3. Follow the step-by-step directions to add customization:
     * For configuring options, go to [Amazon Custom: Product option configurations](/gp/help/G202124210).
     * For personalization, such as text, images, or numbers, go to [Amazon Custom: Product personalization](/gp/help/G202124170).

**Note:** To learn how to apply customizations in bulk, go to [Enable bulk
customizations](/gp/help/QMSBWT4DK5ARMXL).

## Things to remember

  * Your product must be sold in new condition.
  * Custom products must be fulfilled by you. The program isn't available for products that are fulfilled by Amazon. 
  * [Prepare product images](/gp/help/16881) and [add product images](/gp/help/200216080):
    * Include images that show what the product looks like after customization.
    * Make sure the visual elements of your detail page, such as examples and colors, are correctly represented in your customization options.
  * **Appearance:** When you create your listing, check how it appears on desktop and mobile, because the listing’s appearance varies. Always consider the experience for mobile users. For example, if you create a listing on desktop and have instructions for the buyer on one of the preview images, such as “Enter text into the boxes on the right,” you could confuse mobile users because the text boxes display below the preview image on mobile.
  * **Keywords:** Enter specific search terms or keywords for each product to help customers find them on Amazon. Keywords should focus on the most important representative features of each product that you list. Add keywords that accurately represent the product attributes that would be most relevant to customers (often "customizable" or "personalized" for Amazon Custom products). 
  * **Lead times:** Since custom products take longer to produce, it's important to be clear as to when you expect your product to ship once the order is placed. Providing clear information about your lead times can prevent any misunderstanding by the buyer, reduce the chances of a poor seller review, and help ensure that your seller account meets performance metrics. 
  * **Sponsored Product ads:** [Sponsored Products](https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/sponsored-products) gives you more control over product merchandising on Amazon. Targeted ads help you boost the visibility of your products when shoppers search for keywords that you bid on. Consider using Sponsored Products to increase product visibility for new offers, unique selection, offers with low glance views, clearance items, and seasonal promotions.
