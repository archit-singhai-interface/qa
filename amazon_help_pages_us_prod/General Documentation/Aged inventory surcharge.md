Aged inventory surcharge (previously known as the long-term storage fee) is
charged on inventory units stored in Amazon fulfillment network for 181 days
and above.

Aged inventory surcharges are assessed using an inventory snapshot on the 15th
day of each month and is in addition to the monthly inventory storage fee.

We calculate inventory age on a first-in, first-out basis across the entire
fulfillment network. Items that are sold or removed are deducted from the
inventory that has been in the fulfillment network the longest, regardless of
which unit was actually shipped or removed. For example, if an associate picks
and ships a unit that arrived in the fulfillment center only recently, we will
still deduct that unit from the oldest inventory in stock.

## Fee details

The surcharge is charged monthly, typically between the 18th and 22nd day of
the month.

## How to identify inventory subject to fees

Use the [FBA Inventory](/inventoryplanning/manageinventoryhealth) tool to
identify which ASINs are subject to the aged inventory surcharge, including
ASINs that would be subject to the fee within 60 days. On **FBA Inventory** ,
you can locate and filter your inventory by the amount of time it has been in
the fulfillment center. This information can help you estimate the number of
items that will have been in a fulfillment center for more than 181 days by
the next inventory cleanup date.

## Frequently asked questions

#### How can I avoid the aged inventory surcharge?

Active management of older inventory can help you avoid the aged inventory
surcharge. To remove older inventory before the next inventory cleanup date,
consider one of the options below.

**Mark down and sell through Amazon Outlet** : Setting up a deal through
Amazon Outlet can help you sell through older inventory. An Outlet deal is a
promotional offer with a minimum discount of 20%. To learn more, go to [About
Amazon Outlet](/gp/help/GHLYT4TPVCY2MJE3).

**Submit a removal or disposal order** : If you [submit a removal or disposal
order](/gp/help/external/G201436560) for inventory before the cleanup date,
that inventory won’t incur an aged inventory surcharge, even if it isn’t
physically removed before the cleanup date. The deadline for submitting a
removal order is 11:59 p.m. (PT) on the 14th of the month.

Another option for removals or disposals is to set up [automated
removals](/gp/help/GDAET8WDZBB2GFHY).

#### When can you replenish your inventory?

If you remove units of an ASIN that would be subject to the aged inventory
surcharge at the next inventory cleanup date, you won’t be able to send us
more units of that ASIN for three months after that date. There is an
exception to this policy if your inventory levels for the removed ASIN fall
below our running eight-week sales projections.

**Three months after the inventory cleanup date** : Restrictions based on
removals are lifted at this point. For example, if you remove inventory before
the February 15 inventory cleanup between January 16 and 11:59 p.m. (PT) on
February 14, you’ll be able to send more units of that ASIN to fulfillment
centers starting on May 15, unless your ability to send units of that ASIN has
been restricted for another reason.

**Inventory level falls below sales projection** : We base our projection of
your sales of an ASIN for the next eight weeks on your average sales rate for
that ASIN during the preceding 90 days. At any point that your inventory level
for that ASIN falls below eight weeks of cover, the removal-based restriction
is lifted and you can send more units to fulfillment centers.

Your inventory utilization for that ASIN may not exceed the preceding 90 days
of sales, or about 13 weeks of cover. Inventory utilization consists of your
in-stock inventory plus any inventory on its way to a fulfillment center, from
creation of a shipment order to receiving at the fulfillment center.

#### How much new inventory can you send?

For example, if the ASIN you removed sold 180 units in the preceding 90 days,
we would project your sales for the next eight weeks as 112 units based on
this calculation: 180/90 (units sold/day) x 7 (days/week) x 8 (weeks).

If your inventory utilization fell below projected sales (112), you could send
more units of that ASIN to an Amazon fulfillment center, up to the number sold
in the previous 90 days (180). So if your inventory utilization fell to 111
units, you could send up to 69 more units to the fulfillment center (180 – 111
= 69).

The table below provides more examples of how much new inventory you can send
to fulfillment centers after you’ve removed items that are subject to the aged
inventory surcharge.

Sales in preceding 90 days | Projected sales for the next 8 weeks | Inventory on its way to a fulfillment center | In-stock inventory | Total inventory utilization | Do projected sales exceed total inventory? | Number of units you can send  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
270 | 168 | 70 | 100 | 170 | No | 0  
270 | 168 | 70 | 85 | 155 | Yes | 115  
1,000 | 622 | 500 | 200 | 700 | No | 0  
1,000 | 622 | 500 | 100 | 600 | Yes | 400  
9 | 6 | 12 | 10 | 22 | No | 0
