**Audience size**

Audience size is the number of customers that match the audience criteria.
They are the potential recipients of tailored coupons. The audience size may
change from the time you create the coupon to when your coupon is live.
Because more customers may match the audience criteria or some customers may
fall out of the audience criteria in the time between coupon creation and go-
live date.

**Note:** You will be eligible to create brand tailored coupons only for
audiences with 1000 or more customers at the time of coupon creation.

**Access brand tailored audiences in coupons**

Brand tailored audiences are accessible to selling partners with a [Brand
Representative](/help/hub/reference/GJ84K745AL3R5N3Q) selling role for brands
that are registered on Amazon Brand Registry. In the **Select Audience**
section, select **Brand** from the **Audience type** drop-down menu. You will
see the list of all brands for which you are Brand Representative in the
**Brand** drop-down menu.

**Add products to coupons for brand tailored audiences**

While creating coupons for a specific brand tailored audience, you will only
be able to search and add products from the brand selected in **Brand** drop-
down menu. If you sell products from multiple brands, you can create two
separate brand-tailored coupons for same audience type by first selecting
brand and then adding products from that specific brand.

For instance, if you are the Brand Representative for Brand A and B and you
create a coupon for repeat customers of Brand A, only products from Brand A
will be eligible. Create a separate coupon to tailor audiences for repeat
customers of Brand B and add products from Brand B.

**Lead time for coupons with brand tailored audiences**

All brand tailored coupons must be created at least two days before going
live. Brand Representatives will be able to choose the start time for brand
tailored coupons that must be within a minimum of 48 hours from the time of
creation.
