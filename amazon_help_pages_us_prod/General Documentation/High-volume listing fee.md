To cover the costs associated with cataloging and maintaining large numbers of
SKUs on Amazon.com, a monthly fee is applied based on the highest number of
active SKUs from the 5th–31st days of the month. The first 1.5 million SKUs
that meet these criteria will not be charged the High-Volume Listing Fee.
**Sellers do not need to pay the fee for the first 1.5 million active SKUs per
marketplace.**

## Fee details

**Time of charge** | Monthly, on the first day of the month.  
---|---  
**Fee structure** | Per active listing. Single, fixed rate, applicable to listings greater than threshold.   
  
## Values used to calculate fee

**Number of active SKUs above 1.5 million** | You can view a list of your current SKUs that satisfy the criteria for the fee by going to the **Inventory** tab in Seller Central, selecting **Inventory Reports** , and then selecting **High Volume Listings Report** from the drop-down menu on the page.

## Rate card

Eligible SKU count | Rate | Charge frequency  
---|---|---  
Less than 1.5 million SKUs | None | N/A  
More than 1.5 million SKUs | $0.001 per SKU over 1.5 million | Monthly  
  
## Fee example

**Formula** | Monthly fee = (Max count of SKUs – 1.5 million) x rate per SKU  
---|---  
**Examples** | Let’s say you have 1,000,000 active SKUs in a given month. Your High-Volume Listing Fee would be $0 since you have not exceeded your free allowance of 1,500,000 active SKUs. However, if you have 1,600,000 eligible SKUs, you will be charged $100. This fee is calculated as $0.001 on the 100,000 active SKUs over the free allowance.
