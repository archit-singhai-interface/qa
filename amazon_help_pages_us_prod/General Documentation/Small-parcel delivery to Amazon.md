On this page, you will learn about the shipping requirements that apply to
small-parcel deliveries to Amazon fulfillment centers.

  * **Small-parcel deliveries (SPDs)** consist of units packed in individual boxes, and each box is individually labeled for delivery. These are normally smaller shipments that are sent via DHL, UPS, FedEx, or local postal services.
  * Small-parcel delivery (SPD) with a partnered carrier: 200-box limit per shipment.
  * Small-parcel delivery (SPD) with a non-partnered carrier: 500-box limit per shipment.

  * Visit [Shipping and routing requirements](/gp/help/200141510) for weight, dimension, and shipping requirements that apply to all shipping methods.
  * For larger shipments, see [Truckload delivery to Amazon](/gp/help/200280270).

**Note:** While creating your shipment, ensure you are selecting the correct
shipping method for your shipment. Shipments sent under a different or
multiple shipping methods or carriers may experience issues while requesting a
delivery appointment or may be refused at pickup.

Watch this brief video for examples of how to prepare your boxes for shipment
to Amazon fulfillment centers.

## Shipment packing guidelines

If you receive your inventory from your supplier on a pallet, do not assume
the boxes can be used for small-parcel delivery as-is. The standard box and
inner packing used for less than truckload (LTL) and full truckload (FTL)
pallet shipments may not be able to withstand the standard shipping process
for small-parcel shipping, because this packing is designed for bulk pallet
shipments going to brick and mortar retail stores. If these units are damaged
during small-parcel delivery, you may be responsible for damaged units that
are not appropriately boxed and packaged to meet these standards.

##  Guidelines for carriers

  * Only professional carriers are allowed to make delivery appointments with Amazon fulfillment centers. Amazon does not allow general public deliveries.
  * Carriers must register with Amazon before appointments can be made.
  * Carriers must adhere to our delivery requirements and safety standards.
  * Your carrier will need to schedule a delivery appointment through [Carrier Central](https://carriercentral.amazon.com/). For more information, see [Carrier requirements for Less than Truckload (LTL) and Full Truckload (FTL) deliveries](/gp/help/200978420).

## Label boxes

  * Print the full set of labels. Because each label is unique, do not photocopy, reuse, or modify labels for use on additional boxes.
  * All small parcel delivery boxes must have shipment labels, and shipment labels must not include other messaging. If you are reusing boxes from previous shipments, be sure to remove or cover any other shipment labels, barcodes, or markings.
  * Shipment labels must be consistently placed in a way that is easy to see, either on the top or side of the box. Side placement is preferred.
  * Do not place shipment labels on the seam of the box where they could be damaged when the box is opened, making the barcodes unscannable. 
  * Whenever possible, place shipment labels no closer than 1.25 inches from any edge of the box. The tape used to seal the box should not cover the shipment labels.

##  Additional requirements for Amazon Partnered Shipments

If you are using one of Amazon's partnered carriers, you must enter accurate
dimensional data for your small-parcel delivery boxes. These dimensions are
used to calculate dimensional weight, which may be used to determine fees if
the dimensional weight exceeds the actual weight. For more information, go to
[Amazon Partnered Carrier options.](/gp/help/G201119120)

**Important:** Your actual shipping charges may be higher than the amount we
estimate when you create a shipment for the Partnered Carrier program if the
carrier determines that the dimensional data you provided is incorrect.

**Important:** Accurate box weight and dimensions are required for all
shipments, even if you opt to not provide box content information in Seller
Central.
