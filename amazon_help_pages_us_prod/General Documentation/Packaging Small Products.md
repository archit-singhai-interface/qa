On this page, you will learn how to properly prep products that are smaller
than a credit card to protect them from dust or damage throughout the
fulfillment process.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

Any product whose largest side is less than 2-1/8" (the width of a credit
card) needs to be packaged in a poly bag with the barcode on the outside of
the bag to prevent the Unit from being misplaced or lost. This will also
protect the unit from damage by tearing, dirt, dust or liquid during the
fulfillment process. Some products may not be large enough to accommodate a
label, and bagging the unit will allow the barcode to be fully scannable
without wrapping over the edges of the product.

to and storage in Amazon fulfillment centers.
