If a buyer qualifies for tax exempt status, they can request a tax refund.
Buyers will request these refunds directly from you, the seller, according to
the buyer Help content
[here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=202036770&language=en_US&ref=ag_home_cont_202154020).

In order to process a tax refund:

  1. Find the order in [Manage Orders](/gp/orders-v2/list?ref=au_myo_shel_xx) and click **Refund Order** from the **Order Details** page.

  2. At the top of the **Refund order** page, click **Refund tax only**.

**Important:** Unless the order was **fulfilled by Amazon** or **tax is
managed by Amazon** , you will not see the **Refund tax only** button. See the
following section to verify your Fulfillment method and tax collection
obligation for an order.

  3. Select **Tax exempt buyer** or **Order from an unincorporated area**.

  4. For **Tax exempt buyer** , choose an exemption reason.

  5. For **Order from an unincorporated area** , choose one or more of the jurisdictions that you will refund.

  6. Click **Submit refund**.

## Verify your Fulfillment method and tax collection obligation for an order

If you are unable to issue a tax only refund, you can verify if the order was
fulfilled by Amazon or shipped to a state where Amazon manages tax
calculation, collection, remittance, and refunds.

To check the Fulfillment method and tax collection obligation:

  1. Go to the [Manage Orders](/gp/orders-v2/list?ref=au_myo_shel_xx) page.

You should see one of the following options: **Amazon** or **Merchant**.

  2. In the Manage Orders page, check if there is a note next to the tax stating ‘tax is managed by Amazon’ or ‘tax is managed by Merchant’. 

If the fulfillment method is Amazon or the note states ‘tax is managed by
Amazon’, you can refer the customer to contact Customer Support.

If the fulfillment method is Merchant and the note states ‘tax is managed by
Merchant’, the responsibility remains with you to issue refunds.
