There are four ways to find your products:

  

  1. Choose a store from the Amazon home page and then use the various hyperlinks to progressively narrow your criteria until you find your products. Note that your products may appear in more than one location depending on the classification terms you provided.
  2. Enter your product title in the search box on the Amazon home page and search All Products. If your product is not displayed immediately, you may need to choose a category from the Refine Your Search list in the left column and then use the browse box in the left column to progressively narrow your criteria.
  3. Enter your product title in the search box on the Amazon home page and limit your search to the appropriate product category. If your product is not displayed immediately, you may be able to use the links in the left column to progressively narrow your criteria.
  4. Use the **Manage Inventory** feature in Seller Central to view your product details and make note of your product's ASIN. Then use any Amazon search box to search for your product by ASIN. The product detail page should be displayed immediately.

If you added your product to Amazon within the past four days, it may not yet
be searchable by the title and search terms.
