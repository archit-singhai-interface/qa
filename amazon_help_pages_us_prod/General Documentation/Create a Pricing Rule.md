A pricing rule establishes when an automated price change occurs. For example,
you can create a rule that stays $0.10 below the Featured Offer price, or
another rule so your price stays $1.00 above the lowest marketplace price that
uses the same fulfillment channel.

To create a pricing rule, complete the following steps:

  1. From the **Automate Pricing** home page, click **Get Started**. If you have already created a pricing rule and want to create a second rule, click **Create a new pricing rule** from the home page. 

  2. Select what type of rule you want to create from the drop-down menu. Competitive rules (detailed on this page) automate price updates in response to events such as Featured Offer price or Lowest price changes. See [Create a sales-based pricing rule](/gp/help/FRJDFLFPWZSAG67) to learn how to automate price updates based on unit sales.    
Business sellers: See [Create a business pricing](/gp/help/GD29LN5JBS94EL4L)
to learn how to automate business price updates based upon changes to your
consumer prices.

  3. Enter a rule name. This name should be short but descriptive enough to remember later; for example, “Match the Featured Offer pricing rule” or “Holiday low price rule.”    

  4. Select the checkbox for one or more marketplaces where you want the rule to apply. Click **Save and continue** to select rule parameters.

**Note:** You will need to repeat the following steps 5 to 9 for each MP that
you selected in step 4.

  5. Select the checkbox for the marketplace where you want the rule to apply. Click **Save and continue** to select rule parameters.   

  6. Choose the price you want to compare against. You can compare SKUs in your rule to the Featured Offer price or the lowest price for an ASIN. Select either **Featured Offer price** or **Lowest price** from the drop-down menu.

  7. Define the price action you want Automate Pricing to take. You can match, beat, or stay above the **Featured Offer price** or **Lowest price**. Select the option of your choice from the drop-down menu to the right of **Featured Offer price** or **Lowest price**.

  8. Define the amount by which you want the automatic price action to trigger, either as an amount or a percent.

**Note:** You must enter a minimum value of at least 1% or $0.10, and the
maximum percent you can enter is 90%.

  9. Select filters for your rule by selecting the check boxes next to each filter option. Filters allow you to identify the types of offers you want to compare. All Automate Pricing rules apply to offers on the same ASIN and condition. Additional examples of filters might include comparing to only FBA offers, or comparing to only offers from sellers with a seller rating within 5% of yours, or better.

  10. To confirm your rule functions as expected, read the **Rule Summary** for final confirmation. This will be displayed below the filters, and state what your rule does.

When you are finished, click **Save and select SKUs** to move to the next
portion of the Automate Pricing workflow. When you click **Save and select
SKUs** , your rule will be saved, whether or not you add any SKUs to the rule.
Until you assign SKUs to your rule, Automate Pricing will not change any
prices on your SKUs.
