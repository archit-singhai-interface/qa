We will reject an image with an unacceptable or unrecognizable file extension
or file type.  
  
We accept JPEG (.jpg), TIFF (.tif), .PNG, and .GIF file types (JPEG is
preferred). The extension can be upper or lower case.

Verify that your file is in one of the accepted formats by right-clicking the
image file and selecting **Properties**. If it is not in an accepted format,
open the file in an image editing program and **Save As** the correct format
or obtain a file in the correct format from the photographer or scanner.
