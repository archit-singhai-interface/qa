#### What is an appeal questionnaire?

An appeal questionnaire must answer the following questions:

  * What was the root cause that led to the issue?
  * What actions have you taken to resolve the issue?

You can use the following guidelines to create your plan of action:

  * **Be clear and concise.** Be factual and direct. Focus on the facts and events that lead to the issue rather than introducing your product, business, or customer. Remove other questions or references to ongoing support cases from your submission. Avoid using emotive language.
  * **Provide an explanation for all issues.** Some deactivations can be the result of a combination of issues; however, look for the root causes that led to the violations. For example, if there were unverifiable suppliers, inventory management issues, or quality control issues. Provide specific actions that you have taken to address the root causes, making sure to include specific actions, dates of changes, or documentation.
  * **Include supporting evidence for all items.** Make sure you submit supporting evidence for **all** of the products or ASINs that are under review. You can find the list of products at the bottom of your original notification. Make sure to check the timeframe requested for the documents. Some products require invoices from the last 365 days.
  * **Highlight areas in your supporting documents.** You can make your response more relevant by circling or highlighting the area within your documents that is most important. For example, you can highlight ASINs, supplier name, or supplier clauses with your terms and conditions.

You can view the issues that led to your deactivation and submit an appeal on
the [Account Health](/performance/dashboard) page.
