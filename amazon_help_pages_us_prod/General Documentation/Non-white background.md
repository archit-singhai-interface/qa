Non-white background applies to the main image. If your images donâ€™t meet the
content requirements or violate the [Selling policies and seller code of
conduct](/help/hub/reference/G1801), we may remove them. If any image does not
meet the requirements, we may suppress the product listing from search until
you provide compliant images. Regarding text, logo, graphics, and watermarks,
our [Product image requirements](/help/hub/reference/external/G1881) state the
following: "Have a pure white background (RGB color values: 255, 255, 255) to
create a consistent shopping experience for customers across search and
product detail pages.

The Non-White Background attribute is present in the image if either of the
following is true:

  * There is a background and it is not pure white (RGB 255, 255, 255) with minimal shadows around the product, OR
  * There is a visual frame, line, or border on any portion of the edges of the image

Shadows that run to the edge of the image frame or that the product or human
models cast against a backdrop are not allowed. When you use an image that's
edited to remove background elements, any background areas that remain, such
as off-white or gray backdrops, artifacts, objects, or outlines that are added
around the border of the image, are not allowed.

**Note:** Alternate images may have a neutral or environment-based background.

Below are some examples of non-white background on the main image that are not
allowed.
