Amazon regularly evaluates eligibility for products that can be tracked using
manufacturer barcodes. When barcode eligibility changes, products that are not
eligible for manufacturer barcode tracking will need an Amazon barcode in
order to be received at Amazon fulfillment centers.

You will be informed during shipment creation if your products are no longer
eligible for manufacturer barcodes. No action is required for items already
stored or on their way to Amazon fulfillment centers.

**Note:** These changes do not apply if you are the brand owner and have
enrolled your ASINs in the Amazon Brand Registry.

Follow the steps below to change from manufacturer barcode to Amazon barcode
for your affected ASINs and apply Amazon barcode labels to your inventory:  

  1. **Create a new product offer for each affected ASIN and select the Amazon barcode setting:**   

    1. On the [Manage FBA Inventory](/hz/inventory/view/FBAKNIGHTS) page, search for the affected ASIN.
    2. To the right of the ASIN, click the **Edit** dropdown and select **Add another condition**.
    3. On the offer creation page, enter a new **Seller SKU** , fill out the remaining required fields, and click **Save and finish**. Note: You may select the same item condition as your existing offer.
    4. On the **Choose Barcode Type** page, select **Amazon barcode** and click **Save & Continue**.
    5. On the **Convert to Fulfilled by Amazon** page, complete **Add dangerous goods information** and click **Save & Continue**.
    6. If you wish to send your products to Amazon now, please continue creating your shipping plan.

  2. **Apply an Amazon barcode label to your products:**

There are two ways to label your products with Amazon barcodes:

Print your new Amazon barcodes and apply them yourself to each unit. No
labeling fee applies. For more information, refer to [Use an Amazon barcode to
track inventory](/gp/help/G200141490).

OR

Sign up for the FBA Label Service and have Amazon apply the labels for a per-
unit fee. For more information, refer to [FBA Label
Service](/gp/help/G200483750).
