Apparel and accessories may not show any part of a mannequin or hanger in
their product images, regardless of the mannequin's appearance (clear, solid-
color, flesh-toned, or framework).

Invisible-mannequin treatments where the image was edited to remove the
mannequin are not allowed unless the entire product remains visible without
being cropped or obscured. Imaging products flat or on a human model to show
contour and fit is required.

For more details on requirements and examples of compliant images in different
clothing product categories, go to [Clothing and accessories imaging
guidelines](https://m.media-
