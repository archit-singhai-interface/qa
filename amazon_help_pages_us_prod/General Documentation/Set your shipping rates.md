You can set shipping rates for your products in shipping templates. From
**Settings** menu, click [Shipping
Settings](/sbr/ref=xx_shipset_dnav_xx#shipping_templates), and then go to the
**Shipping Templates** tab, you will see options to [create or edit shipping
templates](/gp/help/G201834090) there. For each shipping template, you can
choose one of the following rate models as needed:

## Item or weight-based shipping

If you choose this rate model, when a buyer purchases your products, Amazon
applies the flat per-shipment rate and the appropriate per-weight or per-item
shipping rate you set for the order.

**Example of weight-based shipping rate:**

You set a flat per-shipment rate of $4.00 and a per-pound rate of $0.50. A
buyer purchases two products from you, a 25-pound television and a 1-pound DVD
player. Amazon calculates the total shipping charge to the customer as
follows:

$4.00 + $0.50 x (25 lb. + 1 lb.) = $17.00.

**Example of item-based shipping rate:**

You set a per-shipment flat rate of $4.00 and per-item rate of $1.00. A buyer
orders two products from you. Amazon calculates the total shipping charge to
the buyer as follows:

$4.00 + $1.00 x 2 items = $6.00.

## Price-Banded shipping

Price-banded shipping rate model lets you create ranges or bands of order
prices. Each price band has its own shipping rate. When a buyer purchases your
products, Amazon reviews the total order value to determine which band it
falls into, and then applies the shipping rate you specified for the price
band.

**Example of price-banded shipping rate:**

You create price bands, such as:

**Revenue band** | **Shipping fee**  
---|---  
$0.00 - 50.00 | $10.00  
$50.01 - 80.00 | $5.00  
$80.01 - up | $0.00  
  
A buyer places an order for a total of $75, which falls into the second price
band. Amazon calculates the total shipping charge to the buyer to be $5.00,
based on your price-banded rates.

## Weight-tiered shipping

Weight-tiered shipping rate model is only available in [freight shipping
template](/gp/help/202188040) which is currently offered on request-only
basis. Qualified sellers can create tiers by order weight for freight
shipping. Each weight tier has its own shipping rate. When a buyer orderes
products from you, Amazon identifies which tier the total order weight falls
into and then applies the flat per-shipment rate and the shipping rate for
each weight tier that you have specified.

**Example of weight-tiered shipping rate:**

You create weight tiers, such as:

**Weight tier** | **Shipping fee**  
---|---  
0-100 lbs. | $0.50/lb.  
Greater than 100 lbs. | $0.25/lb.  
Flat rate | $5  
  
A buyer places an order with a total weight of 200lbs. Amazon calculates the
total shipping charge to the buyer to be $80 based on your tiered rates:

$5 + (100 lbs. * $0.50) + (100 lbs.* $0.25) = $80
