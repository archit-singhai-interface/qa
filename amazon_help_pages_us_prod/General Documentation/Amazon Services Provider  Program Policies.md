section: General Documentation
---

These Program Policies apply to any party fulfilling services for Amazon
customers, including services provided attached to the sale of products, and
supplement your Local Selling Terms and Program Policies or Amazon Services
Provider Agreement (the “Agreement”). For purposes of these Program Policies,
Seller, Service Provider, Service Provider’s Affiliates, and their respective
personnel who perform the services will be referred to as “your company”,
“you” or “your;” and Amazon.com Services, LLC or its Affiliates may be
referred to as “Amazon”, “we”, “us” or “our.”

## Services

Amazon reserves the right to prohibit any of your company’s personnel who fail
to comply with the Program Policies from providing services, delivering Amazon
Packages (if applicable), coming onto Amazon property, or interacting with
customers. Failure to meet the requirements contained in these Program
Policies may result in you needing to take immediate action to remediate and
could result, where applicable, in loss of service orders, coverage areas,
route reductions, and/or termination of your Agreement. For purposes of these
Program Policies, “Packages” means any packages, parcels, bags, totes, or
other items, including products, goods or other items intended for delivery,
setup, assembly, or installation by your personnel to or at customer property.

## Service Level Standards

You agree to provide results – including timely and effective delivery of
undamaged Packages (if applicable) and the performance of services to
customers’ and Amazon’s satisfaction – subject to the following standards,
unless otherwise stated within your Local Selling Program Policies or your
Provider Specific Terms (if applicable). While performing services, your
company will be held to Service Level Standards (“SLS”). Your performance will
be measured across a number of SLS metrics, and you will be expected to meet
the SLS targets included in Seller Central and in these Program Policies.
Failure by your company to meet SLS targets may result in action taken by
Amazon including, but not limited to, suspension or termination of your right
to provide services or a suspension of the right of specific Technicians (as
defined below) to provide services. Note, if you cannot meet the Service Level
Standards, you may lose the ability to sell services.

Your company and all of your personnel who may interact with customers in
performing services at any location, or access or enter Amazon property (for
purposes of these Program Policies, your “Technician(s)”) must comply with the
following Service Level Standards, which are calculated daily for orders
completed or canceled during the 0 – 90 days prior:

**Metric** | **Definition** | **Minimum SLA**  
---|---|---  
Cancellation Rate | The number of jobs canceled by you, the customer, or Amazon, for reasons attributed to you- regardless of who initiated the cancellation. Amazon will exclude cancellations due to circumstances out of your control or responsibility. | 1% or less  
Reschedule Rate | The percentage of jobs rescheduled by you, the customer, or Amazon, for reasons attributed to you- regardless of who initiated the reschedule request. Reschedule circumstances out of your control or responsibility are excluded from this metric. | 1% or less for Delivery with Service; 5% for Service-Only orders.  
Customer Feedback Rating | The average customer star rating received on your completed jobs. This metric is calculated based only on jobs that do have a rating, if the customer has not rated the job, it is excluded from consideration. You can review your latest customer feedback at any time in the Feedback Manager under the “Performance” menu. Amazon will work directly with the customer to address poor reviews. Do not reach out to customers directly regarding reviews. If you have a concern, contact Service Central Ops. | 4.7 stars or more  
Negative Feedback Rate | The percentage of your completed jobs receiving a 1 or 2 star rating from the customer. This metric is calculated based only on jobs that do have a rating, if the customer has not rated the job, it is excluded from consideration. | 1% or less  
Happiness Guarantee Claim Rate | The percentage of your completed jobs that suffer from a Happiness Guarantee claim filed by the customer. You can find your Happiness Guarantee Claims under Your Case Log. | 1% of less  
Late Completion Rate | The percentage of your jobs that are marked as “Completed” any time past midnight of the appointment date. | 1% of less  
Outside Arrival Window | The percentage of completed or canceled jobs that are marked as “Job Started” outside the arrival window (either early or late). The arrival window is available on order details. | 5% or less  
  
As part of day-to-day operations, Amazon may reach out to help you achieve
your metrics or protect the customer experience. This may be in regards to a
Happiness Guarantee Claim, operational misses, or customer complaints. When
this happens, you are expected to respond within 2 business days of contact
being initiated.
