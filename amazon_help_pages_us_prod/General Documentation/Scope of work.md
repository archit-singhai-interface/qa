Amazon Home Service's number one priority is to give the best service to our
customers. One **best practice** that we recommend to all of our providers is
to review the scope of work before you request to claim the job.

By reviewing the job details before you claim, you will be able to determine:  

  1. What's included in the service and what's not 
  2. Number of technicians needed
  3. Amount and type of materials needed
  4. Estimated time of completion
  5. Cost of the service

**Tip:** Reviewing the service detail page helps you create a checklist of all
that's needed for you to have the right expectations. It also gives you the
chance to deliver a great service while having a frustration free experience
for you and the customer.
