Amazon policy requires international sellers to ensure that the customer does
not have to pay duties in order to receive the item. To ensure the Customers
do not have to pay duties upon receipt of the item and ensure that you are
compliant with this policy when fulfilling, any products that will require the
customer to pay duties upon receipt will be filtered out if the value of the
item exceeds the duties threshold for the destination country. Currently, Buy
Shipping only offers shipping services for items that are below the duty
threshold. For orders above the threshold, you will need to ship your orders
through other channels to ensure the Customer is not liable for duties.
