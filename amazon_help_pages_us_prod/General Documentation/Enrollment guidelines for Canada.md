Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions so that you can easily find
the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, go to [Canadian Intellectual Property Office
(CIPO)](https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/home) and search for
your trademark by following the steps below:  

  1. Enter your trademark number, keywords, or other identifiable information in the search field and click **Search**.
  2. Find and click your trademark in the search results table.

## Brand name

Confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name under **Index
headings**. Then, in the **What is your brand name?** field of the Brand
Registry application, enter the trademark name exactly as it appears on CIPO.

## Trademark office

In the **Select a trademark office** field of the Brand Registry application,
select **Canada – Canadian Intellectual Property Office – CIPO**.

## Registration and application number

If you’re applying with a registered trademark, enter the registration number
in the application. If you’re applying with a pending trademark, enter the
application number.

**_WIPO number_**

If you’re applying with a trademark that was issued by the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) with designation in Canada, enter the
**Registration number** on **CIPO**. Do not enter your WIPO number into your
Brand Registry application.

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from Canada that are either registered or pending
registration.

To find the status of your trademark on CIPO, review the details under **CIPO
status**.

Then, locate this status in the table below to understand if your trademark is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. In the **What is the
current status of your trademark?** field of the Brand Registry application,
select the appropriate status.

Status on CIPO | Status to select in application  
---|---  
Registered Protected | Registered  
Formalized Searched Default-searched Approved Advertised Proposed opposition Opposed Allowed Default-allowed Refused--appeal in progress Registration pending Default registration pending | Pending  
  
**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

To find your trademark’s type, review the information under **Type**.

If you see "Word", "Standard characters", or "Marque de type mot", your
trademark is a text-based mark (word mark). If you see "Design" or "Dessin",
your trademark is an image-based mark (design mark).

Then, select the trademark type in the **Select the trademark type** section
of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark trademarks are eligible for initial
enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to your
account once you’ve enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your brand](/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
