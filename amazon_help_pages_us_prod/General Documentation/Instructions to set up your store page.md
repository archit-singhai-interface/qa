This page explains how Collab Brands can set up a store page.

You can create your store page through [Amazon Marketing Services
(AMS)](http://ams.amazon.com/).

  

  1. Apply for an AMS account on <http://ams.amazon.com/>. It can take up to two weeks for approval.
  2. Once your account is activated, log in and click **Stores** at the top center of your AMS dashboard.
  3. Click **Create Store**.
  4. Enter the `Brand display name` and upload the Brand logo image.
  5. On providing the Brand display name and logo, you will be able to build your storefront.

Amazon Store provide templates for featured placement tiles for you to create
imagery in the correct specs.
