Dangerous goods (also called hazmat) are substances or materials that may pose
a risk during storing, handling, or transporting because they contain
flammable, pressurized, corrosive, or otherwise harmful substances. To prevent
potential health and safety risks, Amazon gathers dangerous goods information
related to any products sold on Amazon. For more information, go to [Dangerous
goods required information and documentation (hazmat)](/gp/help/201371860).  
  
Note that consumer products such as laptops, smartphones, household cleaners,
spray paints, and cosmetics might also be regulated as dangerous goods. You
can find a list of products that may be regulated as dangerous goods in
[Examples of possible dangerous goods](/help/hub/reference/G200525640).

**Note:** To upload safety data sheets (SDS) and exemption sheets, go to
[Manage dangerous goods classification](/fba/compliance-dashboard/index.html).
For detailed information about these documents, go to [Dangerous goods
required information and documentation (hazmat)](/gp/help/G201371860).

Dangerous goods are divided into nine classes based on specific
characteristics (see sections below). Some classes or divisions within classes
are prohibited for FBA.

**Important:** The physical and chemical properties of a unique, finished
product define whether or not it’s a dangerous good. That’s why there is no
pre-defined classification based on product type. It’s also why we require
specific dangerous goods information and documentation, even if your product
is not regulated as a dangerous good.

##  Dangerous goods that can be sold through FBA

As a seller on Amazon, you must ensure that your products comply with all
dangerous goods regulations. The following dangerous goods can be sold through
FBA:

**Important:** Lithium battery products must meet certain conditions
(according to packing instructions 965 to 970 of latest [IATA
DGR](http://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/index.aspx)). For more
information, go to [Requirements for lithium batteries and products powered by
lithium batteries](/gp/help/G200383420).

## FBA Dangerous Goods program

We also offer the [FBA Dangerous Goods program](/gp/help/GZLZBQ7W6QZRKWWK),
which allows participating sellers to sell additional types of dangerous
goods. To join the US waitlist for the program, do the following:  

  1. Go to **Manage Dangerous Goods Classification** above.
  2. Select **FBA Dangerous Goods program**.
  3. Click **Next**.
  4. Click **Apply to the FBA Dangerous Goods program**. 

If you have inventory in an Amazon fulfillment center that becomes
reclassified as a dangerous good, you will automatically be added to the
waitlist. Once on the waitlist, you’ll be notified when a chance to
participate in the program becomes available.

If you are enrolled in the Dangerous Goods program, you can send additional
dangerous goods in compliance with the program’s [terms and
conditions](/gp/help/GYS2KBEE7MYVCGE3). Products that ship to fulfillment
centers must be:

  * Eligible for FBA
  * Packed in limited quantities (as defined in title 49 of the [Electronic Code of Federal Regulations](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title49/49tab_02.tpl))

**Important:** For shipments of limited quantities of dangerous goods to
fulfillment centers, these are the only accepted labels:

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-
help/Hazmat/DG_AcceptedLabels.png)  

Some classes of dangerous goods even in limited quantities, will be rejected
by Amazon. Products may not only be regulated under the law, but also
prohibited for FBA. For information about country-specific and local laws and
regulations, go to **What cannot be sold through FBA** and **Dangerous goods
regulations and standards** below.

## Recognize dangerous goods

Any warning label or phrase on a product package means that it may be
regulated as a dangerous good. Some dangerous goods products don’t require
warning labels or phrases (for example, cosmetics and speakers with magnetized
material). But the absence of labels or warnings does not mean they aren’t
dangerous goods.

If you think your product may be regulated as a dangerous good, ask the
manufacturer or supplier. The manufacturer is required to provide a [safety
data sheet
(SDS)](/learn/widget?ref_=su_help_pageG201003400_accordion&moduleId=1b4c74b8-4437-4876-8b38-1b1a312b17b4&courseId=babd623d-5853-4c45-97a3-082e85f62820&modLanguage=English&videoPlayer=youtube)
for all regulated products. You must in turn upload this SDS on [Manage
dangerous goods classification](/fba/compliance-dashboard/index.html).

Once the SDS is uploaded, Amazon will review it and classify your product
accordingly, as long as the information is complete and accurate. For more
information, go to [Dangerous goods review process
(hazmat)](/gp/help/201749580) and [Dangerous goods required information and
documentation (hazmat)](/gp/help/201371860).

## Compliance and responsibilities for sellers

Dangerous goods that you send to us must comply with all applicable
regulations to ensure that they are transported, stored, handled, and labeled
safely and correctly. Noncompliance exposes employees, carriers, and customers
to potential health and safety risks.

To sell dangerous goods through FBA, you must do the following:

  * Stay informed about current, relevant legislation and regulations 
  * Provide complete and correct information about your products 
  * Upload a complete, correct, and up-to-date [SDS or exemption sheet](/gp/fba/material-safety-data-sheet/index.html).

**Important:** You will have 14 business days to comply with product safety
compliance requirements. Not providing this information may result in delayed
shipments, canceled customer deliveries, or inventory disposed at your
expense. Amazon reserves the right to take the corresponding actions without
prior notice

When sending inventory to Amazon, you’re confirming that all products comply
with any legal requirements, and that the information provided is complete,
correct, and current.

Providing incorrect or incomplete information may result in your products
being blocked for sale. Corrective actions may also be required, or you may
lose your Amazon selling privileges. Products identified as unfulfillable
dangerous goods upon receipt at a fulfillment center may be disposed of at
your expense.
