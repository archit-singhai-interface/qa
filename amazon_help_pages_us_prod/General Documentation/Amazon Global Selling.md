With Amazon Global Selling, you can list and sell your products on any of our
stores in the America, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Europe. Amazon currently
has 21 stores, allowing you to expand your business. If you are a US-based
seller, then go to [global selling opportunities with
Amazon](https://sell.amazon.com/global-selling.html) for an overview of Global
Selling.

If you are already selling on any of our Amazon stores, then go to [Sell
globally dashboard](/global-selling/dashboard) ( **Inventory** > **Sell
globally** ) to register and start selling on another store. If you are new to
selling on Amazon, then select the country you want to start selling in and
click the below link to register your Seller Central account.

**Note:** Registrations are done on a regional basis, which means that you can
register your account per region (example, Europe, North America, and so on.)
and can then decide on which of the below stores you want to be active.
