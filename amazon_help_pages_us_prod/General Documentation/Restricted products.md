Customers trust that they can always buy with confidence on Amazon. Products
offered for sale on Amazon must comply with all applicable laws, regulations
and internal Amazon policies. The sale of illegal, unsafe, or other restricted
products listed on these pages, including products available only by
prescription, is strictly prohibited.

If you supply goods on Amazon, you should carefully review the Restricted
Products help pages before listing a product. The examples provided in these
Help pages are not all-inclusive and are provided solely as an informational
guide. We encourage you to consult with your legal counsel if you have
questions about the laws and regulations concerning your products. Even where
a product is listed as an "Example of Permitted Listings," all products and
listings must also comply with applicable laws. In addition, any links
provided are for informational purposes only, and Amazon does not warrant the
accuracy of any information provided in these links.

If you supply a product in violation of the law or any of Amazon’s policies,
including those listed on the Restricted Products pages, we will take
appropriate corrective actions to ensure the safety and compliance of products
available for sale on Amazon, including but not limited to immediately
suspending or terminating selling privileges, destroying inventory in our
fulfillment centers without reimbursement, returning inventory, terminating
the business relationship, and permanent withholding of payments. The sale of
illegal or unsafe products can also lead to legal action, which may also
include civil and criminal penalties or forfeiture of goods.

We are constantly innovating on behalf of our customers and working with
regulators, third party experts, vendors, and sellers to improve the ways we
detect and prevent illegal and unsafe products from reaching our marketplace.
Amazon encourages you to report listings that violate Amazon's policies or
applicable law by [contacting us](/cu/contact-us). We will investigate each
report thoroughly and take appropriate action.

##  Additional related policies

  * Sellers must ensure their products are accurately categorized, described, and in compliance with Amazon’s listing standards for any product sold on Amazon, as outlined in its [product detail page rules](/help/hub/reference/external/G200390640).
    * If listings are identified to be purposefully inaccurate, miscategorized, or deceptively described to circumvent any of Amazon’s [Category, product, and listing restrictions](/help/hub/reference/external/G200301050), sellers’ accounts may be subjected to corrective actions, including but not limited to the immediate termination of selling privileges.
  * Certain categories require you to obtain [pre-approval](/gp/help/200333160) from Amazon before listing in those categories. 
  * Certain categories require you to provide additional information and/or a supplemental guarantee before listing in those categories.
