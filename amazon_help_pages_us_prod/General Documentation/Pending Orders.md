On the Manage orders page, an order with a status of Pending might indicate an
issue with the buyer's payment method or a convenience store payment method.
In some cases, our payment and order detail verification processes can
potentially extend order processing times for as long as 21 days.

**Note:**

  * Amazon assumes the risk of buyer non-payment for every order in the **Unshipped orders** report, and for every order that can be confirmed or canceled on your **Manage orders** page.

##  Why is an order pending?

Here are some of the most common reasons for orders being in **Pending**
status:

  * Amazon has been unable to obtain authorization for the buyer's credit card.
  * The buyer selected convenience store payment but hasn't completed the payment.
  * For an FBA order, the buyer has qualified for free shipping and the order is waiting for all of the order items to be gathered.
  * For an FBA order, if the order is for multiple items but one item is out of stock. Even if Amazon chooses to divide the order and send the in-stock FBA Units, the order will still show **Pending** status.
  * For Subscribe & Save deliveries, orders are placed several days before a customer’s upcoming delivery date to align subscription sign-up orders with the customer's weekly or monthly Subscribe & Save delivery date and to ensure that inventory is reserved for upcoming deliveries.

##  What should I do with a Pending status order?

Don't ship an order while in **Pending** status, even if the buyer contacts
you directly. If a buyer contacts you while an order is in **Pending** status
(for example, to cancel a pending order), refer them to Amazon Customer
Service for more information.

Notes for seller-fulfilled orders in pending status:

  * You won't be able to confirm shipment of an order until the order status changes from **Pending** to **Unshipped**.
  * Amazon assumes the risk of buyer non-payment for every order in the **Unshipped orders** report, and for every order that can be confirmed or canceled on your **Manage orders** page.

##  Identify a Pending status order

To identify orders with a **Pending** status, go to the **Manage orders** page
in Seller Central and click the **Pending** tab. All Pending orders that are
to be fulfilled by Amazon can be found on the **View FBA orders** tab. Pending
orders doesn’t appear in either your [Orders report](/gp/help/651) or
[Unshipped orders Report](/gp/help/200133720). However, your inventory will be
updated to reflect the order. For more information, see [Manage your
orders](/gp/help/28141).

## Will my inventory be impacted by a Pending order?

The quantity available for the listing is subtracted from your quantity in
**Manage Inventory**. If there was a quantity of one at the time the order was
placed, the listing will be removed from the Amazon offer page and appear
in**Manage Inventory** with a quantity of zero while the order is being
processed.

## An order is in "Pending" status. Can I cancel it?

Orders are listed as 'Pending' while Amazon is verifying the payment method
provided by the buyer. Pending orders do not include the buyer's shipping
address or contact information and should not be shipped, even if the buyer
contacts you directly. If buyers contact you while their order is in 'Pending'
status, refer them to [Amazon Customer
Service](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us/).

Once the payment method has been verified, the **Confirm shipment** and
**Cancel order** buttons will become available in **Manage orders**. In
addition, the order will appear in both the orders Report and the Unshipped
orders Report. At this point, the order should be shipped (or canceled, if
necessary).
