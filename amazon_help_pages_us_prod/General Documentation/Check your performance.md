## Why it is important  
  
Understanding the quality of service your business offers is essential, this
information lets you know in which factors you need improvement, and at the
same time, enables you to comprehend how to strengthen your performance for
the best results. If your business is striving to qualify for the Preferred
Provider model (link), this is key.

In order to review your performance metrics, go to your **Performance
Dashboard** on the top right side of your Seller Central homepage or click
[here](/hz/local-services/dashboard/performance/ref=ls_pfdash_widget).

You can filter your performance metrics by both the service area and
profession to check specifically how you're doing in an area you may be
seeking to improve and even to qualify for the Preferred Provider model.
