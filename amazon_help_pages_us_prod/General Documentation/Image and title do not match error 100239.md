## Reason for error 100239

This error occurs when your product title information (item_name) contradicts
the main image that youâ€™re submitting for that particular SKU. Your product
data must consistently describe the same product. For example, you may see
this error if your SKU item_name is of a shoe, but your main image is of a
purse.

## Error message

The title and the image that you provided on this SKU don't seem to represent
the same product. Please update either the title or the image so they match,
or contact Selling Partner Support if you believe that we made a mistake.

## Resolve error 100239

Review your main image and item name information. Change the incorrect one and
resubmit your product data.

If your image and title represent the same product, contact Selling Partner
Support, and mention the SKU, item_name, and URL of the main image that you
used.
