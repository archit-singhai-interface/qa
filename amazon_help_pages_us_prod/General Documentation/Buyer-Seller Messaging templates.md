##  Amazon managed response templates

Amazon provides templates that sellers can utilize that will automatically be
translated into the Buyer Language of Preference and help automate workflows.
Any automation that occurs is identified on each template.

If one of these templates is applicable to a Buyer-Seller Message you have
received, you will see the option to utilize that template when you go to
draft a response. Clicking the template button will show a preview of the
message that you can review before sending. If you do not wish to use an
Amazon provided template you can draft your own message as usual or create
your own templates as described below.

##  Seller-managed response templates

As a seller, you might have a handful of messages that you find yourself
frequently sending to buyers. Rather than rewrite the same message each time,
you can create templates for the most common replies that you send to buyers
or use Amazonâ€™s templates for sending new messages.

The response template feature is part of [Buyer-Seller
Messages](/messaging/inbox), which you can access by clicking the **Messages**
link in the top right corner of your seller account home page.

For sending a new message to buyers, you can use the options available on the
Contact Buyer page.
