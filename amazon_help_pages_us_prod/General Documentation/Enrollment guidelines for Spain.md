Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions so that you can easily find
the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, go to [Oficina Española de Patentes y Marcas
(OEPM)](http://www.oepm.es/es/signos_distintivos/index.html) and search for
your trademark by following the steps below:  

  1. Under **Búsqueda simple** , enter the application number or the trademark name in the **Que contenga** search field. You can also click **Búsqueda avanzada** for additional search options.
  2. Click **Localizar**. 
  3. Find your trademark in the search results and click the hyperlink of the trademark name. 
  4. Click the hyperlink of the trademark number, which starts with the letter “M,” “N,” or “H”.

## Brand name

Confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name, which appears at the
top of the trademark record next to the trademark number. Then, in the **What
is your brand name?** field of the Brand Registry application, enter the
trademark name exactly as it appears on OEPM.

## Trademark office

In the **Select a trademark office** field of the Brand Registry application,
select **Spain – Oficina Española de Patentes y Marcas – OEPM**.

## Trademark number

On OEPM, the trademark number appears at the top of the trademark record and
starts with the letter “M,” “N,” or “H.” Enter this number in the **Please
enter the trademark number** field of the Brand Registry application. Include
the leading letter, but don’t include any numbers or letters that appear in
parentheses on OEPM.

**_WIPO number_**

If you’re applying with a trademark that was issued by the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) with designation in Spain, enter the **Trademark
number** on **OEPM**. Do not enter your WIPO number into your Brand Registry
application.

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from Spain that are either registered or pending
registration.

To find the status of your trademark on OEPM, review the details under
**Estado**.

Then, locate this status in the table below to understand if your trademark is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. In the **What is the
current status of your trademark?** field of the Brand Registry application,
select the appropriate status.

Status on OEPM | Status to select in application  
---|---  
En vigor | Registered  
En tramitación | Pending  
  
**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

To find your trademark’s type, review the information under **Tipo**.

If you see "Denominativa", "Denominativo", or "Denominativa estandar", your
your trademark is a text-based mark (word mark). If you see "Mixta" or
"Denominativo con grafico", your trademark is an image-based mark (design
mark).

Then, select the trademark type under the **Select the trademark type**
section of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark trademarks are eligible for initial
enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to your
account once you’ve enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your
brand](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
