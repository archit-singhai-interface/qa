Variations (also known as parent-child relationships) are sets of products
that are related to one another by certain identifiers, such as size, color or
flavor. Good variation relationship listings allow buyers to compare and
choose products based on different attributes such as size, color, or other
characteristics from the available options on a single product detail page.
For example, a customer searching for a short-sleeved T-shirt might click a
product detail page for a T-shirt that comes in three sizes (small, medium,
and large), and three colors (blue, red, and black); rather than having to
browse separate pages for each color and size, the customer can select the
preferred size, and choose the color from the three available color variations
on the same page.

Examples of good variation families are:

  * Items of clothing that come in different sizes (small, medium, large)
  * Items that come in different colors (blue, red, black)

Here is an example of how a variation appears to customers:

**Elements of a variation relationship**

There are four components to variation relationships:

  * **Parent listing: The parent listing is a non-buyable product used to relate child products**

The Amazon catalog uses the parent listing to establish relationships between
the child products. For example, if two shirts have the same parent, then they
are related and are considered child products.

  * **Child products: The products that are related to each parent listing**

The child product is a variation of the parent product, and one parent product
usually has multiple child products. Each child product has a characteristic
that is different from other child products, for example, size or color. A
child product can have only one parent product. The parent product and child
products make a "variation family."

  * **Variation theme: The relationship between the children**

The variation theme is the characteristic that is different from one child
product to another child product. Child products can have more than one
variation theme. For example, t-shirts could have the variation themes of
color and size. Different product categories may have different variation
themes that you can use to list your products. For example, in the clothing,
accessories and luggage category, the variation themes of the child products
could be size and color. In the pet supplies category, the variation themes of
the child products could be flavor, scent and quantity.

  * **Grouping attributes: Products that can be grouped together that are part of the same family**

Grouping attributes define how the products can be variated together. All
products in a variation must share the same grouping attribute to be part of
the same family. For example, "brand" (such as, Amazon Essentials) is a
grouping attribute for apparel. This means that a variation family in apparel
will only include products that have the same "brand" (Amazon Essentials).
Grouping attributes are required and must be identical across a variation
family. Any two products with the same product type that share the same
grouping attribute values can be grouped together in the same variation
family.

**Note:** The difference between "variation theme" and "grouping attribute" in
a variation family is that "grouping attribute" of all child ASINs must be the
same, while "variation theme" value varies among child ASINs. For example,
when the grouping attribute of a variation family is "men's shirt" and
variation theme of the family is color, all child ASINs must be a "men's
shirt", while child ASIN 1 can be of color red while child ASIN 2 can be of
color white.

The following examples illustrate relationship listings in different product
categories:

**Apparel:** In the below image you can see that short sleeve t-shirt is the
parent product. A variation family has been created with "child" products of
different colors and sizes. Hence the variation theme is color/size. Each of
the combinations will be considered a child product. Example: child 1 is short
sleeve t-shirt, color blue and size small; child 2 is short sleeve t-shirt,
color blue and size large.

**Electronics and computers:** In the below image you can see that Computer
monitor is the parent product. A variation family has been created with
"child" products of different colors and sizes. Hence the variation theme is
color/size. Each of the combinations will be considered a child product.
Example: child 1 is a computer monitor, color black and size 21.5 inches;
child 2 is a computer monitor, color black and size 23 inches.

## Parent-child relationship

If an appropriate variation theme exists for your products, you must include
your products in a parent-child relationship.

Not all related products can be listed together in a variation relationship.
For example, Amazon Essentials socks and Amazon Essentials shirts are both
clothing, but they have different usages for a customer and they **would not
be placed in a variation relationship together**. The following questions can
help you to determine whether certain products can be listed together in a
variation relationship:

  * Could the products share the same product title?
  * Would customers expect to find these products together on a single product detail page?
  * Do the products each function in the same way, and have the same purpose for the customer?
  * Are the products different only in a few specific ways that do not affect the function of the product, or the way that customers use the product?

## Category level guidance

  * Do not create variation relationships with products that function in different ways: It is important to ensure that the parent and child products within a variation family have the same product type, brand and title; and similar images. Products that are functionally different should be treated as different products.
    * Example 1: A mobile phone charging cable and a portable charger, while they have a similar use (to charge a phone), are not considered the same product and should not be listed on the same detail page.
    * Example 2: A laptop bag with handles and a laptop backpack are two different products, while they have a similar use (to carry a laptop), are not considered the same product and should not be listed on the same detail page. 
  * Do not use variation themes incorrectly: 
    * Example of a variation theme: A color and size variation theme must not include any information other than color and size respectively. Different phone models, for example, should not be listed within a color theme.
  * Use the standard variation themes and grouping attributes per category: If you want to use variations for your products you are required to use Amazon's standard themes and grouping attributes. In the below table, find Amazon's guidelines on approved variation themes for Towel, Light bulb and Ink and toner product categories.
    * Example of a standard grouping attribute and variation theme: "Amazon Essentials" cotton white t-shirt. Here "Amazon Essentials" (brand) and cotton (fabric_type) are the grouping attributes. The variation theme is color (white) and size (medium). This is a standard grouping attribute and variation theme combination.
    * In the example above, an "Amazon Essentials" cotton t-shirt and an "Amazon Essentials" fleece t-shirt could not be in a variation family. This is because a cotton t-shirt and a fleece t-shirt have different fabric_types (grouping attribute), so they cannot be listed together as variation products on the same detail page.
