For Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) orders, you can change the name and text
on your packing slip in your [FBA settings](/fba/settings/index.html#/). You
can also block your MCF orders from being shipped by Amazon Logistics at the
account level.

In Multi-Channel Fulfillment settings, you can edit the following:

  * **Packing slip–merchant name** : Enter your business name or your website name that should appear on the packing slip with your order.
  * **Packing slip–text** : Enter the text that you want to place on the packing slip with your order. We recommend that you include information about your return policy or contact information for service requests. For example: Thank you for ordering from [website name]. We appreciate your order. For customer returns, go to http://yourwebsite.com/returns.
  * **Block Amazon Logistics** : You can block your MCF orders from being shipped by Amazon Logistics, which will result in a 5% surcharge on your MCF orders. You can block Amazon Logistics at the account level in your MCF settings or, for individual orders, in the [order creation](/mcf/orders/create-order/) page or [MCF API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/fulfillment-outbound-api-v2020-07-01-reference).

Blocking Amazon Logistics may result in some of your orders being unfulfilled,
or estimated to deliver later, if there are no alternative carriers available.

If you block this shipping method through your MCF settings, none of your MCF
orders will ship with Amazon Logistics by default. Changing your Amazon
Logistics preference for individual orders will override your MCF settings
preference for those orders only.
