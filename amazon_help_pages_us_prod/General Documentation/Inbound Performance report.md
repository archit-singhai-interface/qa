The [Inbound Performance
report](/gp/ssof/reports/search.html#orderAscending=&recordType=INBOUND_NONCOMPLIANCE)
gives you detailed, shipment-level information about issues we encountered
with your FBA shipments at the fulfillment center.

Follow the steps below to see your report.

  

  1. On the Seller Central home page, go to the **Reports** tab and select **Fulfillment** from the drop-down
  2. On the **Amazon Fulfillment Reports** page, on the left under **Inventory** , click **Show more** > **Inbound Performance**

When there are problems receiving your products at the fulfillment center, we
typically send you an email and we flag the problem in your [Shipping

You can use this information to see which items in your shipments have had
problems. We may also provide coaching instructions to help you avoid issues
in the future.

**Important:** You may be required to pay an Unplanned Service fee for
problems related to [Packaging and prep requirements](/gp/help/200141500) and
