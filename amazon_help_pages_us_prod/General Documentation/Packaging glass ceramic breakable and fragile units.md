On this page, you will learn how to properly prep products that are breakable
or fragile so that they are protected from breaking throughout the fulfillment
process.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

##  How to prep fragile products

Fragile Units should be packaged so they will not break and possibly create a
safety hazard during storage, shipment preparation, or shipment to the
customer. A fragile Unit must be packaged in either a six solid-sided box, or
completely secured in bubble wrap, so the Unit is not exposed in any way.

Watch this brief video for examples of how to prep your products for shipment
to and storage in Amazon fulfillment centers.

##  Packaging guidelines

Do... | Do Not...  
---|---  
Individually wrap or box all units to prevent damage. For example, in a set of
four wine glasses, each individual wine glass must be wrapped. Box fragile
Units with six solid sides, so the Unit is not exposed in any way. Wrap
multiple Units individually to prevent them from damaging one another within
their package. Make sure your packaged Units can pass a 3-foot drop test onto
a hard surface without breaking. A drop test consists of five drops:

  * Flat on base
  * Flat on top
  * Flat on longest side
  * Flat on shortest side
  * On a corner

|  Leave empty space in the package, which may lower the chance of the
product's ability to pass the 3-foot drop test.  
  
**Note:** Expiration-dated products. Products that expire and are contained in
packaging that requires additional prep, such as glass jars or bottles, must
be prepped to ensure that the expiration date is accessible for Amazon
associates during the receive process. For more information about these
requirements, visit the FBA Help section on [Date- and Temperature-Sensitive
Products](/gp/help/201003420).

## Permitted packaging materials:
