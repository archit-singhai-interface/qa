The [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/seller/registration/participationAgreement.html) requires that
you remove all “unsuitable units” from Amazon fulfillment centers. We will
notify you via automated email if you have any inventory you must remove.  
  
Unsuitable units include those that are unsellable because the customer
returned them in damaged condition. Check the FBA customer returns report for
relevant returns to see if this is the reason your inventory is no longer
sellable.

Unsuitable units will be removed on your behalf in accordance with your
[Automated unfulfillable settings](/recoveryui/removal-setting/automated-
unfulfillable). If you have not configured these settings, your unsuitable
inventory will be disposed of at Amazon’s earliest discretion based on
capacity, including immediately after returns evaluation. You will not be able
to cancel a required removal order once it is created.

**Important:** Inventory removals are subject to a per-item fee. For more
information, see [FBA removal order fees](/gp/help/200685050).

To learn how to create a removal order, see [Remove inventory from a
fulfillment center](/gp/help/G201436560). For information on automating
removals, see [Remove inventory automatically](/gp/help/200678710).
