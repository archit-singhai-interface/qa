On this page, you will learn how to properly prep batteries so that they are
protected throughout the fulfillment process.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for any
unplanned services.

Dry batteries must be properly packaged so they can be safely stored and
prepared for shipment. Ensure that batteries are secured within the packaging
to prevent battery terminals from coming into contact with metals (including
other batteries). Batteries cannot be expired or damaged and, if sold in
packs, expiration dates must be visible on the packaging. These packaging
guidelines include batteries sold in packs and multi-pack sets of batteries.

  * Make sure that packaged batteries can pass a 4-foot drop test onto a hard surface without breaking. A drop test consists of five drops: 
    * Flat on base
    * Flat on top
    * Flat on longest side
    * Flat on shortest side
    * On a corner
  * Ensure that repackaged batteries are in boxes or clamshell packaging that is securely sealed. **If multi-pack batteries are sealed in original manufacturer packaging, no additional boxing or sealing of batteries is required. If the batteries are repackaged, then sealed boxes or sealed hard plastic clamshell packaging is required.** For lithium batteries, follow the applicable regulations as indicated in [Requirements for Lithium Batteries or Products that Contain Lithium Batteries](/gp/help/200383420).

  * Ship batteries that could become loose in/from the packaging.
  * Ship batteries where the terminals may come in contact with each other.
  * Ship batteries that are held together only by zippered bags, shrink wrap, or other non-rigid packaging.

  
  
## Bundled units

Multi-packs of batteries that are bundled and sold as a set must adhere to the
requirements specified in the [Packaging and Prep
Requirements](/gp/help/200141500) help page. Also, the entire bundle must
collectively adhere to the rigid packaging requirements, as described below.

##  Definition of rigid packaging

Rigid packaging for batteries is defined as one or more of the following:

  * Original manufacturer packaging of clamshell plastic or blister packs.
  * Repackaged batteries secured in boxes that have been taped or shrink-wrapped closed. Batteries must not be able to roll in the boxes, and the battery terminals must not touch.
  * Repackaged batteries secured in clamshell plastic that has been taped or shrink-wrapped closed. The battery terminals must not touch within the packaging.
