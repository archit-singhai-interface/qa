If your product’s status is **Inactive (Closed)** , you can relist it at any
time. Follow these steps to relist an Inactive (Closed) product:

  1. From the **Inventory** menu on the Seller Central home page, select **Manage All Inventory**.

**Tip:** On the **Manage All Inventory** page, from the Listing Status drop
down, you can select **Inactive** listings. Alternately, you can sort by
Status: Descending or Status: Ascending so that your listings will be grouped
by status. Find the ‘Closed’ listing you'd like to relist, and from the drop-
down menu on the right end of the row item click Relist.

  2.   

**Note:****If your product status is not ‘Closed’, you will not see the Relist
option.** On the next page, update your offer details for that listing and
click **Save and finish**.

Your product listing will be live on Amazon within 15 minutes. If your product
listing does not display, go to [Fix a "no listing"
error](/gp/help/G200252930).
