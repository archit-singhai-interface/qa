You can complete or close return requests from buyers on [Manage
Returns](/gp/returns/list/v2/ref=xx_myr_dnav_xx) in Seller Central.

## When to complete or close a return request

You may need to complete or close a return request in the following
situations:

  * You decided not to accept an out-of-policy return request that required your authorization, for example, when the return window has passed. 
  * You provided a refund without requiring that the product be returned (returnless refund).
  * You issued a partial refund or a concession in lieu of a return when the buyer didn't return an item.
  * The buyer canceled the return request.
  * The return request is a duplicate.

## How to complete a return request

To complete a return request, follow these steps:

  1. From the drop-down menu in Seller Central, select **Orders** , and then select **Manage returns**.

  2. Under the **Pending actions** tab, select the return request that you would like to complete.

  3. Click **Complete** and provide a reason for completing the request.

  4. Provide a note to the buyer explaining why you completed the return request in the **Message to buyer** text box.

  5. Click **Save**.

## Automatic completion of return requests

Some return requests are completed automatically:

  * Return requests that are refunded in full 
  * Return requests that haven't been acted on within 50 days from return creation, for example, if the item isn't returned to you 
  * Return requests where a partial refund was issued and there was no update for 30 days 

**Note:** You can find completed or closed return requests on the
**Completed** tab on [Manage
