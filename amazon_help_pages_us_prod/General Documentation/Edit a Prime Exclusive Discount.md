There are two ways to edit a discount:

#### Inline edit:

Go to [Prime Exclusive Discount](/prime-discounts) and choose **View details**
from the action cell that corresponds to the discount that you want to edit.
Once the discount details open up, click **Edit discount details** or **Review
discount**. In the **Review discount** section, you can edit the discount
type, discount amount, and minimum price.

#### Bulk Edit via Upload Spreadsheet:

Go to [Prime Exclusive Discount](/prime-discounts), and choose **View
details** from the action cell corresponding to the discount you want to edit.
Once the discount details open up, click **Add more products**. You can upload
new products and update values of existing products, by using the discount
upload template spreadsheet. To edit existing products, make sure that you
choose “e” in the **add-edit-delete** column.

**Note:** It can take up to two hours for the discounted price to be removed
from the detail page. In rare circumstances, updates may be delayed for up to
24 hours due to system latency.
