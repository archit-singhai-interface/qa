If you want to create multiple product listings at the same time, you can do
so using inventory file templates. These templates are tab-delimited text
files (.txt) that include all of the information that you need to list your
products on Amazon.

**Important:** This feature is available to sellers with professional selling
plans. For a newly registered seller, it might take 90 minutes or more after
registering in order to list products for sale on Amazon.

It is highly recommended that you provide appropriate information for your
product listings, to help buyers make a well-informed purchase. Review the
following Help pages for best practices while listing a product:

  * [Amazon Services Quick Start Style Guide](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/help/Selling_on_Amazon_Quick_Start_Style_Guide_2018.pdf)
  * [Product image requirements](/gp/help/G1881)
  * [Product Listing Guidelines](/gp/help/G202073140)

After you create a listing, use [Manage
Inventory](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/inventory/ref=xx_invmgr_dnav) to
make changes to listing or product data.

**Note:** The product information you provide in your listing may differ from
what you see on the Amazon product detail page. For listings with more than
one seller, the information on the product detail page may reflect
contributions from multiple sellers

Refer to [Create listings one at a time](/gp/help/G39EFY66ZLSJQ7PM) for
information regarding how to [add one product at a time](/gp/help/G200220550).
