## Self-service tool

##  How we choose information for the detail page

When multiple sellers sell the same product through a single detail page,
Amazon automatically combines the best product data from various seller
submissions to ensure customers get the best experience. Sellers and
manufacturers can contribute product information on the **product detail
page**. When evaluating contributions, we consider sales volume, refund rate,
buyer feedback, and A-to-z guarantee claims.

## Fix attributes on a product detail page

In the Clothing, Accessories & Luggage, Sporting Goods, and Beauty categories,
display elements such as product title, bullet points, and description are
populated from the parent ASIN instead of child ASINs. If this is a child ASIN
and you would like to see it reflecting different information, you will have
to make updates to the parent ASIN instead. For more information, go to [How
variations appear on product detail pages](/gp/help/G202135360).

To fix a product detail page using the Manage Inventory page, complete the
following steps:

  1. On the [Manage Inventory](/inventory/ref=xx_invmgr_dnav_xx) page, click **Edit** next to the product you want to fix. This will open a new window with the **Edit Product Info** page.

  2. Select the appropriate tab to change the following information: 

Option | Description  
---|---  
**Vital Info** | Update the title and key product information.  
**Images** | Upload new images.  
**Description** | Update the description and bullet points.  
  
  3. Make your edits, and then click **Save**.

**Note:** To manage your images for a listing directly from **Manage
Inventory** , click the **Manage Images** option in the **Edit** drop down
menu for the listing. You will be able to provide suggestions for one main
image and eight additional images.

If your contribution is verfied by Amazon, they will show on the product
detail page within 24 hours. If, after the allotted period, your contributions
do not show on the product detail page, it means Amazon's system has selected
another contributor's information that best describes the product based on the
guidelines set by Amazon.

**Important:** If you are a seller with a [selling
role](/help/hub/reference/GJ84K745AL3R5N3Q) (Brand Representative or Reseller)
assigned in the brand, register products to your brand before suggesting
changes to your product detail page. For more information, go to [Registering
products to your brand](/gp/help/G6DU75NSM86VXKZC).  If the suggestions made
to the registered ASINs are not displayed after the above time-frame, please
ensure with the brand Administrator that the Brand Representatives are aligned
on listing contributions before submitting any new catalog updates.

## Fix product variations on a detail page

Some product detail pages offer variations, such as color, pattern, and size.
If you think a seller might have added a variation to a product that is
different than what's indicated in the product detail page, we can fix it.
Incorrect variations can lower customer confidence in whether they are buying
the right product.

Before requesting a correction, review the following errors and examples:

Variation error  |  Description  |  Example   
---|---|---  
Different product |  The variation for the product is completely different from the product detail page. |  The product detail page is for a toaster, but the variation is for a pencil.  
Same product, different brand |  The variation appears to be the same product, but is manufactured under different brands. |  The product detail page is for "Sony Stereo Headphones" but the variation is for "Bose Stereo Headphones."  
Same brand, different product line |  The brands match, but the products are different. |  The product detail page is for "UGG Women's Classic Short Boot" but the variation is for "UGG Women's Slipper".  
Similar product types |  The variation is for a product from a similar category, but for a different product type. |  The product detail page is for "Women's Leggings" but the variation is for "Women's Slacks."  
Version |  The variation is for a different release version of the same product that is materially different from the previous version. |  The product detail page is for "Remote Control X4 Helicopter and 4 Button Remote" and the variation is for "Remote Control X5 Helicopter and 5 Button Remote."  
  
If any of these scenarios exist, you can submit a request for Amazon to fix it
by using the above self-service tool.

## Proof requirement for updating attribute information on detail page

**Important:** If you do not have a selling role (Brand Representative or
Reseller) assigned in the brand, you must provide proof supporting the
suggested changes to the product detail page. Acceptable proofs for attribute
update requests are:

  * Manufacturer's or publisher's (for books) website URL clearly showing the suggested changes, along with a visible product identifier (such as UPC, EAN, ISBN), if available.
  * High-resolution product pictures, clearly showing the suggested changes, along with a visible product identifier (such as UPC, EAN, ISBN).
  * A high-resolution photo of the item in its original packaging showing the product identifier (such as UPC, EAN, ISBN) code and the attribute or attributes that must change.

Manufacturer's or publisher's (for books) website URL is the only acceptable
proof for product image update requests.

Any requests without valid proof supporting the changes will not be accepted.

To fix product attributes in bulk, upload an inventory file template that
includes the corrected product information.
