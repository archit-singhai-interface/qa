For most categories, you are required to associate your products with
industry-standard product identifiers to create new product pages and offer
listings on Amazon. These IDs help ensure product page accuracy by matching
listings to products that already exist in the Amazon catalog.

Product IDs are part of a system of unique identifiers called GTINs, or Global
Trade Item Numbers. The following are the most common GTINs used to create
Amazon catalog pages:

#### Universal Product Codes (UPCs)

A UPC is a standard product identifier to help you sell your product.

#### International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)

An ISBN is a product identifier used specifically for books, and is usually
associated with a publication date.

#### European Article Numbers (EANs)

An EAN is a type of product identifier used specifically for products for the
European marketplace. This product identifier is also referred to as an
international article number.

#### Japanese Article Numbers (JANs)

A JAN is a type of product identifier used specifically for products for the
Japanese marketplace. This product identifier is also referred to as an
international article number.

Product IDs are different from Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs)
because they are used by many systems outside of Amazon.

**Note:** The use of false product identification information, including
product IDs, is prohibited and can result in your ASIN creation privileges
being removed. Product IDs will be confirmed against the GS1 database. For
more information, see [Product Detail Page Rules](/gp/help/G200390640) and the
[ASIN Creation Policy](/gp/help/G201844590).

To find a product ID:  

  1. Check the [Product ID (GTIN) requirements by category](/gp/help/G200317520) to see if your product has specific ID requirements. 
  2. Look for ISBNs, UPCs, EANs or JANs above or below the bar code on the packaging (or cover) of your product. GTIN-14s appear on the shipping container. 

**Note:** If your product does not contain a product ID, you can request for
an exemption. For more information, see  [How to list products that do not
have a Product ID (UPC, EAN, JAN, or ISBN)](/gp/help/G200426310).

If you do not have a product ID for your product, you can request it from the
manufacturer. If you manufacture the product yourself, visit the [GS1
standards website](https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes) for more
information.

Sellers in the United States can visit the [GS1 US standards
website](http://www.gs1us.org/) for EANs. You can also find ISBNs at the [U.S.
ISBN Agency](https://www.myidentifiers.com/).

## Where to use product IDs
