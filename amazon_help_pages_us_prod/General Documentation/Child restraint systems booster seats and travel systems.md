If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## Child restraint systems, booster seats, and travel systems covered by this
policy

A child restraint system, also known as a car seat, booster seat, or an infant
safety seat is a removable device designed to be used together with the seat
of a vehicle in order to restrain and protect a child from injury or death
during vehicle collisions. Child restraint systems are products that have
rigid or semi-rigid frames and include pads or foam to provide insulation in
the event of a collision.

**Forward-facing child restraint systems**

A forward-facing child restraint system is a removable device designed to
position a child to face in the direction of travel of the motor vehicle. It
has a harness and tether that limits your child's forward movement during a
crash.

**Rear-facing child restraint systems**

A rear-facing child restraint system is a removable device designed to
position a child to face in the direction opposite to the normal direction of
travel of the motor vehicle.

**Infant restraint systems**

An infant restraint system is a removable device designed to be a hand-held
carrier for newborns and small babies. Infant carriers have a seat back that
is intended to be in a reclined position (more than 10 degrees from
horizontal). This policy applies to travel systems, hand-held infant carrier
and infant car seat bases, including standalone bases sold without carrier.
Travel systems include full-size, stand-alone strollers with a compatible
infant car seat that clips into the stroller.

**Motor vehicle booster seats**

A motor vehicle booster seat is a removable device designed to raise and
position a child so that the vehicle’s lap-and-shoulder belt fits properly
over the stronger points of a child’s body, the hips and across the chest.
Booster seats are not tightly installed in the vehicle the way that car seats
are. Booster seats are held in place by the child’s weight and the vehicle’s
lap-and-shoulder belts. Booster seats are either a backless child restraint
system or a belt-positioning seat.

Backless child restraint systems (i) consist of a seating platform that does
not extend up to provide a cushion for the child’s back or head, and (ii) have
a structural element designed to restrain forward motion of the child’s torso
in a forward impact.

Belt-positioning seats (i) position a child on a vehicle seat to improve the
fit of a vehicle belt system on the child, and (ii) lack any component, such
as a belt system or a structural element, designed to restrain forward
movement of the child’s torso in a forward impact.

**Fabric restraint systems**

Fabric restraint systems, also known as fabric car seats, are products made of
fabric (for example, nylon or cotton) with straps, clips, and padding. They
are intended to restrain a child in a car. These products lack any type of
metal or hard plastic frame. They are foldable and lightweight.
