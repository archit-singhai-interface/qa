Merging accounts unifies your selling experience across Amazon’s international
stores and lets you more easily manage and scale your business. You can also
gain access to tools previously restricted to a single country, as well as
receive a discounted [subscription fee](/gp/help/GAB9AXEU2FEC4GXM) for the
Professional selling plan.

## Check if you already have merged accounts

Your merged accounts are listed in the store switcher in the top navigation
bar of Seller Central. If you have accounts that are not listed there, you can
merge them using the following instructions.

If you already sell in multiple countries or regions and you want to merge
these accounts:

  

  1. Sign in to **Seller Central** and select **Sell globally** from the **Inventory** drop-down menu.
  2. From the **Sell globally** page, click the **Merge accounts** tab.
  3. Follow the direction on the page and select the accounts that you want to merge.
  4. When prompted to sign in again, enter the email and password for the other account that you want to merge.
  5. Once you sign in, you will see a preview of the newly merged accounts.
  6. Click **Confirm and merge** button, accept the terms and conditions, and then click **Confirm and merge** button again.

## Register to sell in a new region and merge the account

If you want to sell in a new country or region:

  

  1. Sign in to **Seller Central** in a country or region where you are already selling, and select **Sell globally** from the **Inventory** drop-down menu.
  2. Click the tab of the country or region where you want to register.
  3. Click **Register** for the country or region where you want to sell.
  4. If asked to sign in again, use the email and password for the region where you are already selling.
  5. Complete the registration by providing additional details, if asked. The new countries where you have registered to sell will be merged automatically when you are finished.

## Merging of accounts policy

All sellers are expected to adhere to the following policy when merging their
accounts. Merging of accounts is permanent. Once you have merged your
accounts, you will not be able to undo the merge.

  * You can only merge accounts for which you are the owner.
  * If you are a Solutions Provider, web agency, or integrator managing the account, do not merge accounts. Instead, have the account owner and have them take this action directly. Once merged, accounts cannot be unmerged.

## Professional selling plan subscription fees for merged accounts

To help you grow your business, we are offering you the possibility to sell in
multiple countries at a reduced price. If you merge your accounts, your
monthly fee will be one of the following, whichever is lower1:

  * The sum of the subscription fees for each country in which you have active listings; or
  * The equivalent of $39.99 USD per month

For example, if you maintain merged Professional selling plan accounts in
India (no subscription fee) and Mexico (600 MXN/$30.43 USD subscription fee),
and have active listings in both stores, you would pay a subscription fee
equivalent to $30.43 USD per month, billed to your Mexico account as 600 MXN.
If you maintain merged Professional selling plan accounts in the US ($39.99
USD subscription fee), Europe (€39/$45.94 USD subscription fee) and Japan
(¥4,900/$44.18 USD subscription fee), and have active listings in all three,
you would pay the equivalent of $39.99 USD, billed to your US account as
$12.09 USD, to your European account as €11.79, and to your Japan account as
¥1482.

Your subscription fee will be split proportionately across each country or
region in which you have an active listing and charged separately in each
local currency.2 The reduced fee will be applied automatically if you already
sell in multiple countries with your merged accounts. You can see the fee in
the transaction details section of your Payments report. If you sell in
multiple countries, but are not doing so with merged accounts, follow the
steps above to ensure your eligibility for this offer.
