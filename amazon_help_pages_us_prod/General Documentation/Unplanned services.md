Fulfillment by Amazonâ€™s (FBA) [Packaging and prep
requirements](/gp/help/200141500) and [Shipping and routing
requirements](/gp/help/200141510) provide the requirements for our fulfillment
centers to accurately receive and store your products. If you do not follow
these requirements, Amazon sends your items through an alternate path for
unplanned services, such as prep, labeling, and manually processing shipments,
which may delay our processing of your inventory and affect your ability to
sell products quickly.

FBA tracks problems encountered at the fulfillment center in order to provide
you information and insight into your supply chain. You can view your [Inbound
performance summary](/gp/help/200893760) for further details on problems we
experienced receiving your shipments at our fulfillment centers and the
actions you can take to avoid these issues in the future.

**Note:** To understand what actions Amazon generally takes when there are
repeated issues with receiving and processing your shipments, review the
[performance coaching](/gp/help/G5H26MCVJG4B82ST) help page.

## About unplanned service fees

In some circumstances, FBA may charge you an unplanned service fee if items
you sent us did not include the required label or prep when they arrived at
the fulfillment center. Unplanned service fees are charged per unit. Rates are
shown in the table below.

Problem group | Problem | Problem rate | Unplanned service fee based on coaching level  
---|---|---|---  
Standard  Per-unit charge  |  Elevated  Per-unit charge  |  Critical Per-unit charge   
**Label missing - product related** | Amazon barcode missing | Product level | $0.20 | $0.40 | $0.40  
**Unplanned prep - product related** | Taping | Product level | $0.20 | $0.40 | $0.40  
**Unplanned prep - bagging** | Bagging | Product level | $0.70 | $1.40 | $1.40   
**Unplanned prep - bubble wrap** | Bubble | Product level | $1.00 | $2.00 | $2.00  
  
**Note:** For the problems listed above, you will only be charged an unplanned
service fee when we provide you an image to help illustrate the reported
problem. We track label and prep issues through multiple methods, and when
these systems do not include an image, we will alert you to the problem but
will not charge you an unplanned service fee.

##  Disputing Unplanned Service fees

If you believe FBA charged you an unplanned service fee in error, you can
submit an investigation request to dispute it. If you do so, we will review
the issue reported at the fulfillment center and will assess if a
reimbursement is due. We will only consider investigation requests you submit
within 30 days of when the problem is reported to you. For more information on
how to dispute an unplanned service fee, see [Resolve inbound performance
issues](/gp/help/3FFQ2AHWU69GTDW).

If a reimbursement is approved, you can see your unplanned service fee
reimbursements in the following locations:

  * The **Fee total** column of your [Inbound Performance report](/reportcentral/INBOUND_NONCOMPLIANCE/0). Fee reimbursements appear as a negative fee adjustment. 
  * The **Reason** column of your [Reimbursements report](/reportcentral/REIMBURSEMENTS/0). 

You should receive your reimbursement with the next scheduled Amazon payment.
If you don't, check the status of the dispute in [your case log](/cu/case-
lobby). Search for the relevant case and click **View** or **Respond**.
