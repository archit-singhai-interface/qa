The Amazon Business Seller program enables you to optimize your offerings to
grow sales to business customers.

While business customers can already purchase your products on the Amazon
site, Amazon Business provides access to additional pricing, business profile,
and brand-building features designed to reach a growing population of
procurement professionals. Features like Business-only offers, Quantity
pricing, and the ability to list credentials like small business, veteran-
owned business, ISO 9001, and others give Amazon Business sellers tools to
leverage the Amazon marketplace to reach business buyers.

##  What happens when you join the Amazon Business Seller Program?

You can access B2B features through your existing Seller Central account and
SP-API. [Go to the linked page for more about the Amazon Business Seller

Amazon Business sellers can take advantage of tiered referral fees that result
in a lower fee percentage when business customers buy in bulk. [Learn more
