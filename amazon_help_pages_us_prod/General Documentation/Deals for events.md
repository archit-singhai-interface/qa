To submit a Deal for event consideration:  

  1. On the [Deals dashboard](/merchandising#/dashboard/create), check **Upcoming Events** to see the events that are open for Deals submissions. Events include Prime Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and others.
  2. Select the desired event in the **Schedule** box as part of the Deal. You can submit Deals for multiple event and non-event weeks.

## ASIN eligibility

You can see if an ASIN is eligible for event consideration in two places:

  * On the [Deals dashboard](/merchandising#/dashboard/create), the event options are in the **Date** column drop down.
  * As part of creating a new Deal choose the desired event when you select **Schedule** for the Deal.

If you do not see the event available in the **Schedule** , your ASIN
currently does not meet the criteria to be considered for the event.

## Deal selection

We canâ€™t guarantee that your deal will be selected to run on the event. In
order to improve the probability of your deal being selected, select the deals
that you believe will get customers most excited to buy. Deals with greater
available quantity and inventory may also have an advantage in being selected.

All eligible ASINs with the event in the **Schedule** option meet the base
criteria for event consideration. We will choose the Deals that have a large
available quantity and inventory and provide a diverse mix of deals for
customers.

To learn how to make your products eligible for deals, go to [Amazon
deals](/gp/help/202111490).

## Deal fees during events

The event week includes a time period during which customer traffic in Amazon
Stores may be significantly higher, which may lead to greater exposure and
potential sales for your Deal.

Depending on your locale, you could see a fee variation. The fee or fee
variation is displayed when you select **Schedule** as you create the Deal. If
your Deal is scheduled during a higher traffic time period, you could be
charged a higher fee. If your Deal is scheduled outside of the higher traffic
time period, you could be charged a lower fee.

If you are unsatisfied with the resulting fee, you can cancel the Deal before
the Deal is expected to run. Get information about [Understand deal
fees](/gp/help/202111590).

## Deal date and time

The date and time of your deal will be revealed in Seller Central at least one
week before the deal is scheduled to run. If your deal has been selected for
the event, the start and end dates will state the name of the event (such as
Prime Day, Cyber Monday), along with the time your deal will run. If your deal
has not been selected for the event, the start and end dates will reflect the
week-long timeframe.

## Manage a deal for events

In order to ensure that your Deal runs on the event, monitor your Deal
regularly and make any relevant changes to keep it in the **Upcoming** status.
Consider following the **Tips for running successful Deals** section on the
**Deals** page to promote your products further.
