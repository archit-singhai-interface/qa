**Note:** The Expiration Date of the product must be at least 185 days in the
future from the Inbound shipment creation date in order to be eligible for AWD

In addition to product eligibility, we also validate that the products that
you are sending meet the following FBA requirements:

  * **Restricted product categories** : For certain categories, you're required to get pre-approval from Amazon before you list your products. Review FBA guidelines to ensure that you're eligible to sell products for these categories. For more information, go to [Categories and products that require approval](/gp/help/200333160).
  * **Stranded inventory** : FBA inventory in fulfillment centers that doesn't have an active offer and isn't available for sale on Amazon is considered stranded inventory. When inventory is stranded, you must either reactivate the listing or remove the inventory. Before you send inventory to Warehousing and Distribution, resolve stranded inventory issues. For more information, go to [Stranded inventory overview](/gp/help/G201436600).
  * **FBA barcodes** : FBA uses barcodes to identify and track inventory throughout the fulfillment process. Therefore, each item that you send to a fulfillment center via Warehousing and Distribution [requires a barcode](/gp/help/G201100910). You can print Amazon barcodes and apply them to your products yourself, or you can have Amazon print and apply them for a per-item fee.
  * **Product listing issues** : Product listings in the destination store must be valid before you send inventory to Warehousing and Distribution. For more information, go to [Create listings one at a time](/gp/help/G39EFY66ZLSJQ7PM).
  * **Missing catalog attributes** : Product details must be provided accurately in the product catalog. For more information, go to [Suggest changes to your product detail page](/gp/help/200335450).
  * **Seller account performance issues** : If there are any performance issues with your seller account or the item that you're sending to Warehousing and Distribution, you won't be able to send inventory. All issues must be resolved before you can send the product to Amazon. For more information, go to [Resolving inbound performance alerts](/gp/help/G3FFQ2AHWU69GTDW). 

Contact [Selling Partner Support](/help/center) if your products are
incorrectly labeled as dangerous goods (hazmat), or the dimensions of the
products are incorrect where you are not able to add the ASINs to the AWD
shipment.
