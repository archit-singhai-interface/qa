If you operate a business established in one of the European Union ("EU")
countries and have received a VAT Registration Number from the tax authorities
in that country, you may submit that VAT registration number. We will use this
information to determine whether VAT will be charged on your seller fees.

Before submitting your VAT registration number, you must read the following
information carefully. You may only submit your VAT registration number if you
acknowledge and agree to all the conditions set out below.  

  1. The VAT registration number you submit to Amazon belongs to the business you operate and from which you are selling on Amazon.
  2. All transactions on your Amazon Seller Account will be business-related transactions made by the business associated with the VAT registration number you submit to Amazon.
  3. Your VAT registration number and all other information provided by you is true, accurate and current, and you will immediately update any such information held by us in case of any changes.
  4. All information including your VAT registration number will be collected, processed and maintained in accordance with the terms set out in the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement and Privacy Notice.
  5. Amazon reserves the right to request additional information and to confirm the validity of your Seller Account information (including your VAT registration number) from you or government authorities as permitted by law. You agree to provide any such information to us upon request.
  6. Amazon reserves the right to charge you any applicable unbilled VAT if you provide a VAT registration number that is determined to be invalid. You irrevocably authorize Amazon to debit your credit card for any such unbilled VAT.
