## Send shipments through SEND

**FBA shipment creation workflow**

You can use SEND to select an Amazon partnered carrier (APC) within the FBA
shipment creation workflow. You can send shipments through air-shipping from
Vietnam to the USA. To book an FBA shipment with the APC, follow the below
steps:

  1. To create an FBA shipment, go to **Inventory** and select **Shipment**. Go to **Shipment** drop-down and choose **Send to Amazon**.

  2. In Step-1, select the products and the quantities you plan to send to FBA. Once you have selected the inventory and quantity, provide inputs on the packing details. For more information on packing configuration, go to [Send to Amazon: Choose inventory to send](/gp/help/G8SXKYFWPG6DAW6T).   

    1. If the products are single-SKU boxes such as case packs, then select the appropriate packing template, or create a new packing template and select **Ready to send**. Follow this process for all the products that you plan to send to FBA and select **Confirm and continue**.
    2. If the boxes are mixed-SKU boxes, choose the inventory to send. Choose **Individual units** and select **Ready to pack**. Follow this process for all the products that you plan to send to FBA, and select **Pack individual units**. This will take you to **Step-1b** where you must provide the packaging box details. After providing the box details, select **Confirm and continue.**

  3. Now, you will be redirected to Step-2 where you must provide the shipping details.

  4. Provide accurate information under **Shipment packing** , including box weights in pounds and dimensions in inches. For multiple boxes, enter box weights, and dimensions for each box in the shipment.

  5. Select **SEND Amazon partnered carrier (Air Express or Ocean)** based on your desired transit time or cost and mode of shipping.

  6. Effective March 1, 2024, you can select one of the following FBA inventory inbound placement options while creating a shipping plan as per your requirements to optimize your total logistics fees:   

    1. **Minimal shipment splits:** You can send your inventory to the minimal number of inbound locations, generally to a single location, and Amazon will spread inventory across our network on your behalf, for an inbound placement service fee. The fee may vary by inbound location, for example, there may be higher fees for shipments sent to locations in the west versus other parts of the country.
    2. **Partial or Amazon-optimized shipment splits** : Send your inventory to multiple inbound locations yourself for a reduced or no inbound placement service fee. The reduced fees will depend on the number of shipments and inbound locations that you send your inventory to. For instance, if your shipping plan qualifies, you can select the inbound placement option to send your inventory to the optimal number of inbound locations recommended by Amazon, generally four or more locations, and pay no fee. If you select the placement option in which you send your inventory to a partial number of inbound locations, generally two or three, you will pay a reduced inbound placement service fee. The availability of these inbound placement options is based on several factors, including the product types and quantities that you have in your shipping plan, your existing inventory levels across our network, and the location of customer demand. When you create a shipping plan, you’ll see a fee estimate for each available inbound placement option. You’ll be charged this FBA inbound placement service fee 45 days after your shipment is received, based on the inbound location and the quantities received. For more information, go to [2024 FBA inbound placement service fee](/gp/help/GC3Q44PBK8BXQW3Z).

**Note:** This inbound placement service fee estimate **does not include** the
carrier shipping fees (refer to step 9 below). The carrier shipping fees can
differ basis the inventory inbound placement option (number of shipment splits
and region, as applicable) chosen by you.

  7. Choose the desired ship date for the shipment and pick up or drop off option. If you do a drop off, you can find the drop off details in the APC requirement section.

  8. Select Origin Port to ship out from Haiphong or Ho Chi Minh (only applicable for Ocean).

  9. Click **Get Shipping cost** to generate the estimate for carrier shipping fees based on the box dimensions and weight. This fee does not include custom duties charged by the US customs.

**Note:** You will be charged the final carrier shipping charges and customs
duties (if applicable) after the shipment is delivered. The final charges will
be according to the actual weight and dimensions of the shipment, as per the
APC audit. The shipping cost estimate is based on the weight and dimensions
you declare. To ensure that the final charges are the same as the estimated
shipping costs, ensure that you enter the accurate weight and dimensions of
the shipment.

  10. Select the carrier with the options given and click Continue to shipping parties.

  11. After confirming the shipping parties, enter the information required for customs clearance as listed on SEND for your applicable shipment.   

    1. **Shipper Type** : Individual or Company (only applicable for Vinalink Ocean and DPE Air carrier).
