Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions so that you can easily find
the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, go to [Japan Platform for Patent Information
(J-PlatPat)](https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/) and search for your trademark
by following the steps below:  

  1. Under **Simple search** , select **Trademark**. 
  2. Enter your trademark name, registration number, or any other identifiable information in the search field and click **Search**.
  3. Find and click your trademark in the search results table.

## Brand name

Confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name next to **Trademark
(for search)**. Before entering the trademark name in the **What is your brand
name?** field of the application, review the information below:

  * If the symbol,「￠」, appears next to **Trademark (for search)** , then your trademark contains a Latin-based alphabet character (for example, 「`」、「'」、「^」、or「¨」). When entering the trademark name in the application, include the Latin-based alphabet character and ensure that it matches the diacritical mark in the image shown under the **(540)** section.
  * If symbols like 「▲ 」or「▼」appear next to **Trademark (for search)** , then your trademark contains a character that isn’t defined on J-PlatPat. When entering the trademark name in the application, do not include these symbols. The trademark name must match the text that appears in the image shown under **(540)**. 
  * Do not include the following symbols when entering your trademark name in the application: 「§」,「∞」,「、」, or「＼」.
  * If the name next to **Trademark (for search)** appears in Japanese (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji), you don’t need to match the spacing when entering the trademark name in the application. However, if the name appears in English, then you must enter the trademark name exactly as it appears (including spacing) on J-PlatPat in the application. 

## Trademark office

In the **Select a trademark office** field of the Brand Registry application,
select **Japan – Japanese Patent/Trademark Office – JPO**.

## Registration and application number

If you’re applying with a registered trademark, enter the registration number
in the application. If you’re applying with a pending trademark, enter the
application number.

**_WIPO number_**

If you’re applying with a trademark that was issued by the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) with designation in Japan, enter the
**Registration number** on **JPO**. Do not enter your WIPO number into your
Brand Registry application.

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from Japan that are either registered or pending
registration.

The status of your trademark appears at the top of the trademark record on
J-PlatPat.

Locate this status in the table below to understand if your trademark is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. Then, in the **What is
the current status of your trademark?** field of the Brand Registry
application, select the appropriate status.

Status on J-PlatPat | Status to select in application  
---|---  
Live-registration-issued and active Live-registration-published for opposition Live-registration-opposition pending Live-registration-cancellation/invalidation pending | Registered  
Live-application-awaiting examination Live-application-under examination Live-application-appeal of refusal pending Live-application-published for opposition Live-application-opposition pending Live-application-awaiting examination (formality examination unfinished) | Pending  
  
**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

Use the table below to understand your trademark’s type.

Trademark on J-PlatPat | Trademark type to select in application  
---|---  
An image is displayed under the **(541)** section | Word mark  
An image is displayed under the **(540)** section and the **(531)** section is present in the trademark record | Design mark  
An image appears under the **(540)** section, but the **(531)** section isn’t present in the trademark record | Design mark or word mark  
  
Then, select the trademark type under the **Select the trademark type**
section of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark trademarks are eligible for initial
enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to your
account once you’ve enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your brand](/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
