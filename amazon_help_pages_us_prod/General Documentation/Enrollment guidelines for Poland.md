Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions so that you can easily find
the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, go to [Urząd Patentowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej
(UPRP)](https://ewyszukiwarka.pue.uprp.gov.pl/search/simple-search?lng=en) and
search for your trademark by following the steps below:  

  1. Under **Types of IPR** , uncheck all of the options except **Trademarks**. 
  2. Enter the registration or application number of your trademark in the search field using the format below:  

    1. Registration number: R.12345 
    2. Application number: Z.12345 
  3. Click **Search**.
  4. Find and click your trademark in the search results table.

## Brand name

Confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name next to **Name/title**.
Then, in the **What is your brand name?** field of the Brand Registry
application, enter the trademark name exactly as it appears on UPRP.

## Trademark office

In the **Select a trademark office** field of the Brand Registry application,
select **Poland – Patent Office of the Republic of Poland – PPO**.

## Registration and application number

If you’re applying with a registered trademark, enter the registration number
(R.12345) in the application. If you’re applying with a pending trademark,
enter the application number (Z.12345).

**_WIPO number_**

If your trademark was issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO), you can confirm its registration number by going to the [WIPO IP
portal](https://www3.wipo.int/madrid/monitor/en/index.jsp) and following the
steps below:  

  1. Under **Search for** , enter the trademark number that was issued by the WIPO, the trademark name, or other identifiable information in the search field. 
  2. Click the magnifying glass icon to search. 
  3. Find and click your trademark in the search results table. 
  4. Confirm that the registration number that appears next to your trademark name (directly above the **Full details** tab) matches the number you have on file. 

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from Poland that are either registered or pending
registration.

To find the status of your trademark on UPRP, review the details next to
**Status**.

Then, locate this status in the table below to understand if your trademark is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. In the **What is the
current status of your trademark?** field of the Brand Registry application,
select the appropriate status.

Status on UPRP | Status to select in application  
---|---  
Udzielenie prawa | Registered  
Zgłoszenie ujawnione | Pending  
  
**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

To find your trademark’s type, review the information under **Type**.

If you see "słowny", your trademark is a text-based mark (word mark). If you
see "słowno-graficzny", your trademark is an image-based mark (design mark).

Then, select the trademark type under the **Select the trademark type**
section of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark trademarks are eligible for initial
enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to your
account once you’ve enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your
brand](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
