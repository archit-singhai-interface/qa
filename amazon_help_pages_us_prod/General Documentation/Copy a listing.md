The **Copy listing** feature allows you to create a new product detail page
using information from an existing listing.

For example, you have three different versions of the same toy. Each version
has a different product identifier, such as UPC, EAN, or JAN but shares the
same manufacturer, brand name, product description, and target audience. You
can create a detail page for one of the product versions and then use the
**Copy listing** feature to quickly create pages for the other two versions.
For more information, refer to the table below.
