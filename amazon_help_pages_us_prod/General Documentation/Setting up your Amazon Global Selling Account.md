You will need to set up your Amazon selling account for the online marketplace
where you want to sell. Even if you already sell in one Amazon marketplace,
you will need to create a new seller account in another marketplace. For
example, if you sell on Amazon.com and want to sell on Amazon's European
marketplaces, you need to create a new Amazon seller account in Europe, such
as a unified account that includes multiple Amazon Europe marketplaces
(Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands).

The exceptions are:

  * If you already sell in an Amazon North American marketplace, such as Amazon.com, and want to sell in another Amazon North American marketplace, such as Amazon.com.mx. In this case, you can do so from your current seller account, because Amazon offers an [Amazon North American marketplaces account](/gp/help/201394090).
  * If you already sell in an Amazon European marketplace, such as Amazon.co.uk, and want to sell in another Amazon European marketplace, such as Amazon.es. In this case, you can do so from your current seller account, because Amazon offers an [Amazon European marketplaces account](/gp/help/201468460).

If you already have an account in another region, you can [link your
account](/gp/help/help.html?itemID=201841950&language=en_US&ref=id_201841950_cont_2)
by going to the [Sell Globally Dashboard.](/global-selling/dashboard/)
