**Note:** This feature is currently available for Professional sellers only.

An inventory file template enables you to add or edit product listings in
bulk. It is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that contains multiple data columns
for describing your products using various attributes or information fields.
You can create a template to suit your specific requirements and list
different types of products across multiple categories using one template. The
templates include the correct Browse Node, removing the need to find them from
the Browse Tree Guide.

If you previously used the Category specific and Book Loader templates, you
must begin using the Product Templates. If you submit an old template, you may
receive an error in your **Processing Report**. Go to [Add Products >
Spreadsheet > Check Upload
Status](https://www.sellercentral.amazon.com/product-
search/bulk/generate/status), to download your previously submitted data in
the newer version by clicking on the **Download Processing Summary** beside
your upload status.

**To create your inventory file template:**  

  1. Go to [Add Products > Spreadsheet > Download a blank template](/product-search/bulk/generate).
  2. Select the card that best describes your intended template usage, which includes but is not limited to list new products, update price and quantity, and update product detail.
  3. When you are listing products that are not currently in Amazon’s catalog, go to [Add Products > Spreadsheet > Download a blank template > List Products ](/product-search/bulk/generate/add-product) that are not currently in Amazon’s catalog.
  4. Select the type of product you want to sell by using either one of the following methods:   

    1. **Search tool** :   

      1. Describe your product with keywords or your product title (for example, “beanies for women”, “Patagonia travel poster canvas wall art”) in the search box and click **Search**. More detailed descriptions can streamline the search results.
      2. Relevant Item type keywords are preselected based on your input and you can edit this list before or after selecting the product type.
    2. If you do not find the type of product you want to sell, you can browse via the **Product Category** :   

      1. Select the category in which your product belongs.
      2. Continue to narrow the classification options until the **Select** appears.
      3. Click **Select** to add the classification to your list.
      4. Repeat the above steps to classify all your products.
  5. Review your selected products. You can edit your product list by removing specific products that you no longer want to include in your template.
  6. Select the stores where you are intending to create or edit the listings; the rest can be unchecked.

## Filling the template

You have to use the Product template to add products that are not currently
listed in Amazon’s catalog. The template shows the required, conditionally
required, and recommended attributes. Conditionally required attributes become
required based on your inputs on the required attributes. Optional attributes
are collapsed in each attribute group. To expand the optional attributes,
click the "+/-" signs on top of the column. Alternatively, on the top left
corner of the sheet, you can select "1" or "2" to expand or collapse all the
optional attributes. The "1" shows the default view, and the "2" shows the
advanced view with all the attributes. In the default view, the first
attribute in the group is not hidden, so that you can find the specific
attribute group. For more information, download and read the instructions in
the template.
