## Seller Wallet pre-registration checklist

To ensure that you’re eligible to use Amazon Seller Wallet, review the
following eligibility requirements:

  * You must have a seller account for the US. 
  * Your seller account for the US must be in good account health to be eligible for Seller Wallet. To confirm your status, go to [Account Health Rating: Frequently asked questions](/gp/help/GR786P4BPEVKTBAG).
  * You must have proof of business establishment (or a proof of residency if you intend to use Seller Wallet as an individual seller) and have a local phone number in one of the supported countries or regions for Seller Wallet. For more information, [view the list](/gp/help/GKD4GS8VTWVYCWRH) of Seller Wallet supported countries and currencies. 
  * You will use Seller Wallet only for business or commercial purposes.
  * You don’t currently have an outstanding loan from a third-party lender through the Amazon Lending program. If you do have this type of outstanding loan, you can register for Seller Wallet after your loan is paid off and closed.

By default, your seller account will be granted access to Seller Wallet once
your registration has been processed. If you’re sharing your seller account
with anyone else, for your Seller Wallet account safety, we recommend that you
change your seller account password under the **Settings** drop-down menu.

You can also manage Seller Wallet access for your authorized user accounts
after your Seller Wallet registration has been processed.
