We expect that all products for sale in Amazon stores or sent to Amazon are
manufactured and produced in accordance with [our Supply Chain
Standards](http://amzn.to/supply-chain-standards), even when our standards
exceed the requirements of applicable law. We are strongly committed to
ensuring that these products are produced in a way that respects human rights
and the environment and protects the fundamental dignity of workers.

We evaluate credible allegations or reports of violations of our Supply Chain
Standards, including, but not limited to, those related to the following
issues:

  * Forced, indentured, or child labor 
  * Discrimination, harassment, or the physical, verbal, or psychological abuse of workers
  * Environmental issues, such as industrial or hazardous waste discharges, that pose a risk to workers or the community
  * Hazardous or unsafe working conditions
  * Ethical violations 

We may ask you to provide certain documentation regarding your products or
supply chain. More information can be found on the **Responsible sourcing
documentation** page.

If we believe that your products violate applicable laws or any of our
policies, including our Supply Chain Standards, we will take corrective
actions as appropriate. These actions may include, but are not limited to,
returning inventory at your expense, immediately suspending or terminating
selling privileges, destroying inventory in our fulfillment centers without
reimbursement, or terminating the business relationship.
