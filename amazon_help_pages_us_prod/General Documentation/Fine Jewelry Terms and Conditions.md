  * All the products I intend to sell are new and authentic. I understand that counterfeit, replica, or knock-off products are prohibited on Amazon.
  * I will not price any jewelry item above $125,000.
  * I understand that any white diamond products containing single stones that are 0.75 carats or greater (rings and pendants) or two stones that are greater than 1.0 carats (stud earrings) must be accompanied with an original grading report or certificate of authenticity from either GIA, IGI, AGS, or GCAL.
  * I understand that I must participate in a Jewelry Quality Assurance Review as part of the Fine Jewelry Application Process. This review includes submitting a selection of my Fine Jewelry items that I intend to sell on Amazon for review. I understand that it takes around six weeks, but may take up to 10 weeks, to process my application, including the submission of my sample items for review.
