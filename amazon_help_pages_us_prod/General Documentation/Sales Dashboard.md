**Individual sellers:** This feature is only available to sellers with a
Professional selling plan. Learn more by visiting [Selling plan
comparison](/gp/help/64491).

The Sales dashboard, located in [Business Reports](/gp/site-
metrics/report.html), includes the **Sales Snapshot** , **Compare Sales** ,
and **Sales by Category** features. The data presented in the Sales dashboard
is updated approximately once per hour.

The **Sales Snapshot** feature displays up-to-date sales statistics and order
metrics as described in the [Business Reports Glossary](/gp/help/27691).

**Compare Sales** is an interactive feature:

  * Filter results by using the **Date** and **Fulfillment Channel** filters at the top of the page.
  * Filter results by using the Sales Breakdown filters to see sales by **Marketplace total** ,**Business buyers** , and **Non-business buyers**.
  * You can choose to view sales statistics as a graph (the default) or in a table. Use the buttons at the upper right to select your preference.
  * Select points in time to compare against your **Date** filter choice, by checking the boxes below the graph or table.

For example, if you set the **Date** filter to **Today** , the "Compare"
choices are to compare today's sales to **Yesterday** , **Same day last week**
, and **Same day last year**. If you select **Year to Date** , the "Compare"
choices are **This year** and **Last year**.

**Note:** It is likely that sales from the current fraction of a day will be a
fraction of the previous comparable dayâ€™s sale. As a result, the latest data
point on the graph may appear to indicate a drop in sales data. This pattern
is more apparent early in the current day and less apparent later in the
current day.
