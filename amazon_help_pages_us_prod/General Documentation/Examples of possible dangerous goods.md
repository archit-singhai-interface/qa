Dangerous goods (also called Hazmat) are substances or materials that might
pose a risk while storing, handling, or transporting because they contain
flammable, pressurized, corrosive, or otherwise harmful substances. The list
of products below does not contain every potential dangerous good in each
category, but represents the types of dangerous goods that you might encounter
among your listings, and can therefore serve as good examples to increase your
ability to identify dangerous goods.

To learn more about dangerous goods, see the [Dangerous goods identification
guide (hazmat)](/gp/help/201003400). You can also watch the following video in
Seller University: [Dangerous goods overview](/learn/courses?moduleId=401).

When products might be regulated as dangerous goods, you must provide Amazon
with specific product information and documentation (for example, a Safety
Data Sheet) via [Manage dangerous goods classification](/gp/fba/material-
safety-data-sheet/index.html). For more information, see [Dangerous goods
required information and documentation (hazmat)](/gp/help/201371860).

Use the **Look up an ASIN** tool to check the classification status of your
FBA ASIN.
