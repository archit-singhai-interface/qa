The goal of the Merch Collab brand profile is to provide designers with
specific direction, to create designs that you are likely to approve. Provide
the do's and don'ts about your brand and any logos and assets, for the
designers to leverage. As a brand, you can update and edit your brand profile
any time.  
  
While providing the below details is optional, it is highly recommended, to
establish the quality of design submissions you would like to receive.

  * Include clear do's and don'ts.
  * Be specific with approved image/asset usage.
  * Provide a robust description of what your brand is (including brand history and vision) and your brand's core audience (age, gender, interests, etc.).
  * Include images of any existing merchandise your brand has, as a reference.
  * Include a mood board to convey your brand vision.
  * Provide insights into your design review timelines and cadences. Often, designers want to know when they can expect to hear back from you.
