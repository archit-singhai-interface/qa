Our 2023 **Extended Holiday Returns policy** requires that items purchased
between November 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, are returnable through
January 31, 2024, except for Apple brand products, which can be returned
through January 15, 2024.

This policy applies to seller-fulfilled, FBA, and Amazon retail orders.

Although the returns window for most orders will be extended, returns
eligibility for all orders remains the same.
