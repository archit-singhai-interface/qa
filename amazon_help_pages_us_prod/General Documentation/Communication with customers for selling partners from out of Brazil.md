All communication with customers on Amazon.com.br must be carried out in
Portuguese, the official language of Brazil. If you are not proficient in the
language or do not have a member of your team fluent in Portuguese, you can
use a translation tool or hire a service provider to manage communication with
customers. If necessary, the partner can consult the Amazon Service Provider
Network at **Apps and Services** > **Explore Services** , looking for the
**Account Management** service type. Communication with customers must be
clear and agile, in order to provide the best possible experience. For more
