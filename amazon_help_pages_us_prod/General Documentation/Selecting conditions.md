Using condition types helps you to list offerings in a range of conditions,
such as new and used. For many product lines, seller offerings in multiple
conditions help to expand the buying choices available to customers.

To update conditions, go to the **Manage Inventory** page, click **Edit** from
the drop down and choose **Add another condition**. This allows you to create
the same listing with another condition.

When buyers view a product page, they see a generic product description along
with a set of buying choices. Links on the product page lead to offers in "new
& used" condition. Listings are displayed on the offer listing page for each
product and are grouped to allow buyers to sort and select offerings by
condition or price.

**Note:** Certain categories only allow listings for new products. For a list
of condition types available for each category, see the [Condition
guidelines](/gp/help/G200339950).

The following options show how to submit items with conditions.

  * You can submit items with the appropriate condition types and a condition note using Add a Product, text files, or XML feeds. See [Add a Product](/gp/help/G1831) to select your product's condition from a drop-down list.
  * Use Text files such as the Inventory Loader and Listing Loader for product matching that also require condition types.

**Note:** When using category-specific inventory files, any listings submitted
without an explicit condition type will default to “New.”

For help selecting the appropriate listing tool for your needs, see [Compare
and Choose Listing Methods](/gp/help/201576400).

For BMVD products, we strongly recommend that you specify the condition type.
In addition, sellers approved to list in the Collectible Books category may
use special listing attributes to enhance the visibility of certain condition
details on the offer listing page. See the following Help pages for more
information.
