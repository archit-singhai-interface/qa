**Definition** | Product dimensions and volume are measures of the product’s size when fully packaged and ready to ship in accordance with [FBA policies and requirements](/gp/help/201030350).   
---|---  
**Using this article** | Product dimensions and volume are critical inputs to determining the product size tier. Along with product weight, dimensions are used to calculate a variety of FBA fees, including storage fees, fulfillment fees, and returns processing fees. This article shows you how to determine the dimensions and volume of your items.

## Determine your product dimensions and volume

**For new products** , measure your fully packaged product.

  1. Measure the dimensions of a single unit of your product in inches:
     * Longest side (length): The dimensions of the longest side of the item.
     * Median side (width): The dimensions of the side that is neither the longest nor the shortest.
     * Shortest side (height): The dimensions of the shortest side of the item.
     * Girth: The dimensions of the median side plus the shortest side, then multiply by 2. 
     * Girth plus length: The girth plus the longest side. 

**Note:** These values are used to determine the product size tier for an
item.

  2. Calculate the product volume in inches:

Product volume = Longest side x median side x shortest side

  3. Convert the product volume from inches to cubic feet for storage fee calculations:

Storage fees are based on cubic feet. To convert the product volume from
inches to cubic feet, divide product volume in inches by 1,728. Note that
1,728 is the volume of 12 cubic inches (12 x 12 x 12 inches = 1,728).

**Important:** If a product is sold as a set, the weight and dimensions are
the combined total of all of the items in the set packaged together.

**For existing products,** you can look up your product volume and dimensions.

If you have stored a product as FBA inventory, you can look up your product
volume and dimensions using the [Monthly Storage Fees
report](/reportcentral/STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES/1):  

  1. Download the report.
  2. Identify the product of interest by its FNSKU.
  3. View the product volume in the **item-volume** field.

For products you don't sell that already exist on Amazon, you can look up the
product dimensions in order to calculate the volume using the [Revenue
calculator](/fba/profitabilitycalculator/index):  

  1. Search for the product.
  2. View the **Package Dimensions** values.
  3. Use the formulas above to calculate the product volume and other dimensions.

**Note:** Amazon may verify the weight and dimensions of a product using
representative samples. Amazon’s information about a product’s weight and
dimensions will be used to calculate fees if there is a difference between
Amazon’s information and a seller’s information. Amazon may change its
information about a product’s weight and dimensions from time to time to
reflect updated measurements. Fees based on the weight and dimensions of a
product are calculated using Amazon’s information about the weight and
dimensions of that product at the time the fee is calculated.

## Example of product dimensions and volume calculation

A unit measuring 47 x 12 x 10 inches:

Dimensions:

  * Longest side (length): 47 inches
  * Median side (width): 12 inches
  * Shortest side (height): 10 inches
  * Girth: (12+10) x 2 = 44 inches
  * Girth plus length: 44 + 47 = 91 inches

Volume:

  * Product volume (inches): 47 x 12 x 10 = 5,640 cubic inches
  * Product volume (cubic feet): 5,640 / 1,728 = 3.3 cubic feet
