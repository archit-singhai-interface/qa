## Large and Oversize

This page is intended for 3P sellers who are interested in selling Large and
Oversize items. Large and Oversize items are often high-consideration for
customers given their cost and challenge in shipping. This page is intended to
provide guidance and best practices to interested sellers to improve both
customer and seller experience when selling Large and Oversize items.

#### What is Large and Oversize?

Large and oversize 3P ASINs or packages are sometimes referred to as 'Heavy
and Bulky'. These items are often packages that require special handling and
importantly, have unique fulfillment fees, storage fees, and cost more to
ship. Examples of Large and Oversize items include: lawn and garden items,
sports equipment, and appliances. Note that, any item that requires “Special
Handling” or “White Glove Service” are also considered Large and Oversize.

#### What size packages are considered Large and Oversize?

For items to be considered Large or Oversize, they must meet the criteria in
the following table:

Storage type | Packaging criteria | Dimensional criteria  
---|---|---  
Extra-Large | If length is 70 to 96 inches, item must be classified as Ship in own Container or “SIOC”. See Packaging Criteria below for details. |  Any of the following: 

  * Longest side 70 inches or more (40 inches or more for TVs) 
  * Girth + length 130 inches or more 
  * Unit weight 50 lb or more 

  
Oversize | No requirements |  Any of the following: 

  * Longest side 18 to 70 inches 
  * Median side 14 inches or more 
  * Shortest side 8 inches or more 
  * Unit weight 20 to 50 lb 

  
  
**Note:** Girth = (median side + shortest side) x 2.

#### Packaging criteria for Large and Oversize items:

If the package's longest side (length) is between 70 and 96 inches, it must be
classified as Ships in Own Container (SIOC). This means that your item should
arrive at the Amazon facility in its original packaging and should be able to
withstand delivery to the buyer without [over-boxing](/gp/help/G200141500).
For more information about SIOC, go to [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging
Program Certification
Guidelines](https://assets.aboutamazon.com/f9/ab/568df63a4b2c82c1ecf3b562f202/amazon-
frustration-free-packaging-program-certification-guidelines-v10.4__2021.pdf).

If the item length is 96 inches or more, it is not required to be classified
as Ship in Own Container or “SIOC”.

#### How do I enroll in Large and Oversize?

specifications. You are automatically enrolled into this program if your item

## How do I ship a Large and Oversize Item?

You can ship Large and Oversize items two different ways:

  

  1. Large and Oversize Items can be shipped via standard US Domestic Non-Freight. More information, go to [USPS Domestic and International Services](/gp/help/G200204090).
  2. [Freight-Shipping Template:](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/G202188040?mons_sel_mkid=amzn1.mp.o.ATVPDKIKX0DER&mons_sel_mcid=amzn1.merchant.o.A2419185BIMFYR&mons_sel_persist=true&stck=NA) This template is for heavy and bulky items that require less-than-truckload (LTL) shipment (usually >150lbs), such as furniture, pallets, and domestic appliances. These deliveries require you or your carrier to contact the customer after the order was placed to set up a delivery appointment. The freight-shipping template provides you with two options for arranging delivery to the customer: **Arranged Freight Delivery** and **Scheduled Delivery**.  

    1. **What is Arranged Delivery?** This option requires you, or your carrier, to contact the customer via phone or Buyer-Seller Messaging within 2 business days of the order being placed, to set up a delivery appointment time. At checkout, customers are notified that they will be contacted to arrange the date of the delivery, and are given an option to update their phone number. This is the default shipping option, and will always be enabled for products listed on the freight-shipping template. Note that all calls to customers should happen between 8am - 8pm based on the customer’s local time zone.
    2. **What is Scheduled Delivery?** The customer will see the available delivery slots, and will have the option to pick any available slot at their convenience. You can use Seller Central to offer either day or day and time slots during which you or your carrier can deliver. This is an optional shipping method for freight templates, and you will have the choice to enable this ship option alongside Arranged Freight Delivery. If the customer selects Scheduled Delivery, you are not required to contact them post-order. All Scheduled Delivery orders will have a “Scheduled Delivery” message displayed on the [Manage Orders](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/orders-v3/ref=xx_myo_dnav_xx?page=1) page along with the date of delivery.
