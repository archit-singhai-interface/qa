One-Day Delivery is a fast, premium shipping option that is only available to
sellers who meet high delivery performance standards.  
  
## Requirements for One-Day Delivery eligibility

Enrolling in One-Day Delivery does not automatically offer your products for
One-Day Delivery. You must meet a set of requirements for One-Day Delivery:

  * Be registered to sell on Amazon for at least 90 days
  * Have an on-time delivery rate of at least 95% for One-Day Delivery orders
  * Have an on-time shipment rate of at least 99% for One-Day Delivery orders
  * Be able to meet the following performance requirements on a trailing 30-day basis:
    * An [on-time delivery score](/gp/help/200633610) of at least 92% for Premium Shipping orders.
    * A [valid tracking rate](/gp/help/201817070) using IDs from UPS, USPS, Fedex, or OnTrac for at least 94% of Premium Shipping orders.
    * A [cancellation rate](/gp/help/200285210) of less than 1.5% for Premium Shipping orders.
    * A minimum order threshold of at least 10 orders across all shipping options on a trailing 30-day basis.

## Set up One-Day Delivery

If you are eligible to offer One-Day Delivery, follow these steps to set it
up:  

  1. From the **Settings** drop-down menu, select **Shipping settings**.
  2. To select a shipping template that you would like to enroll in One-Day Delivery, click the **Edit template** button on the far right.
  3. For a non-Prime template, check the One-Day Delivery checkbox, and click **Add new shipping rule** to add your One-Day Delivery regions.
  4. For a Prime template, click **Edit Prime regions** , go to the **One-Day Delivery** tab and select your One-Day Delivery regions.
  5. After you select the regions, you can enter your shipping rates in the One-Day Delivery section and then click **Confirm**.

## Why are you not eligible for One-Day Delivery?

If your current status on the [Premium Shipping
eligibility](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/seller-
rating/pages/eligibilities.html?language=en_US&ref=ag_xx_cont_G202167050) tool
is **Not eligible** , it is because one or more of your performance metrics is
below the required threshold. During this time, we'll deactivate the One-Day
Delivery option on your offers for 30 days. You can generate detailed
performance reports from the [Customer metrics page](/gp/customer-
experience/summary.html?).

If you meet the performance metrics after 30 days, we'll reactivate the
shipping option, and your status on the **Premium Shipping eligibility** tool
will change to **Eligible**. However, you must continue to meet the
performance requirements or you will lose One-Day Delivery eligibility again.

**Note:** Only metrics for seller-fulfilled orders appear on the **Premium
Shipping Eligibility** tool. We use these to calculate your eligibility to
offer Two-Day Shipping. Metrics on the **Premium Shipping Eligibility** tool
might differ from Account Health because Account Health is a combination of
seller-fulfilled and Amazon-fulfilled metrics. Performance metrics are
calculated and recorded once a day. Metrics on recent orders might not appear
on this page for at least 24 hours.
