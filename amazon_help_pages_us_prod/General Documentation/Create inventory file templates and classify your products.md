Product classification helps customers find your products when they are
searching on Amazon. Amazon uses values provided by sellers to determine where
listings appear in the Amazon catalog. If this information is missing or
incorrect, customers will have a difficult time finding, comparing, and
purchasing your products.

**Important:** Inventory file templates are only available to professional
sellers. However, [product classifer
tool](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/productclassify) is available to all
sellers. If you previously used a [Browse Tree Guide](/gp/help/G1641), the
files are still available. However, we recommend you transition to the Product
Classifier, which includes the most current and accurate information on the
Amazon website structure. For more information, see [Classify your products
using Browse Tree Guides](/gp/help/G1661).

To identify the right classifications for your products, professional sellers
can use the Search tools and Product Classifier as shown:  

  1. Go to the **Inventory** tab and select [Add Products via Upload](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/listing/download). **Download an Inventory File** tab opens as the default option. 
  2. Under **Step 1: Select the Types of Products You Want to Sell** , browse for the appropriate classification of your product using eother one of these options:  

    1. Search tools: 
       * Type the name or key product descriptor words in the search box and click **Search**.
       * Select the type of product you want to list. Click **Clear Search** to move to the next search.

**Note:** You can make multiple selections if you are selling products with
different classifications.

    2. Product Classifier:
       * Select the category in which your product belongs.
       * Continue to narrow the classification options until the **Select** button appears.
       * Click **Select** to add the classification to your list.
       * Repeat the above steps to classify all your products. 

**Note:** A lock sign next to a product indicates you need approval to sell
this product on Amazon. For more information, see [Categories and products
requiring approval](/gp/help/G200333160). If you are unable to find your type
of product, check for category-specific templates under the **Inventory
Files** section below on the same tab. Use these templates only if you are
unable to find your type of products using the above tools.

  3. Review your selected products. You can edit your product list by removing specific products that you no longer want to include in your template.
  4. Under **Step 2: Select the Type of Template** , select a mode for your template type that you want to generate: 
     * Advanced: It contains all the attributes (required, preferred, and optional) associated with the selected products. 
     * Custom: You can choose attribute groups associated with the above selected products that you want to add to your template. It also includes the required attributes. 
  5. Click **Generate Template**.

**Note:** The generated template will download to your browser and you can
save a copy to your local hard drive. Now you can populate your inventory file
template or XML feed with the classifications that match your SKUs and with
other offer data. Sellers using XML feeds can use an [XML
upload](/gp/help/G200374090).

## Populate the classification fields in your inventory file

To add your selected classifications to your inventory file template files:

  1. Open the inventory file, and select the **Template** tab.

  2. For each row of the template (which represents one SKU) start by selecting a **Product Type** in the first column of that row from the dropdown of valid values.

  3. Then select the **Item Type Keyword** in the same row from the dropdown of valid values.

**Note:** If you would like to list a product with a different **Product
Type** you may have to generate a new template that includes that Product Type
to ensure that all required attributes are present in the file.
