## Frequently asked questions

#### Will the peak fulfillment fee apply to products ordered before October
15, 2024?

MCF fees are calculated and charged when shipments leave fulfillment centers.
As a result, if a product is ordered before October 15, but is shipped on or
after that date, the peak fulfillment fees will apply.

#### How do I determine what product size tier my product belongs to?

Use the [size tiers table](/gp/help/G201105770) to determine your product's
size tier.

#### What are the fees to ship to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or
Alaska?

MCF will include the following surcharge on non-peak fulfillment fees for any
orders that are delivered to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Alaska,
or non-contiguous US locations:

  * 100% for standard-size items 
  * 200% for oversize items

#### How do I calculate my total fulfillment cost during the peak period if my
shipped product incurs other surcharges?

Add peak fulfillment fees to the base fulfillment fee before applying any
percentage-based surcharge. Examples include the surcharge for shipments to
non-contiguous US locations and the surcharge for [blocking Amazon
Logistics](/gp/help/G200332450) from shipping your orders.

For a small standard-size, 2-oz item that’s shipped to Hawaii during the peak
period with a standard shipping speed, the total fee is ($6.99 + $0.19) x (1 +
100%) = $14.36.

This fee example is calculated as follows:

[Standard non-peak period fee (4 oz or less) + peak period increase] x (1 +
100% standard-size item surcharge) = Total fee
