Sellers can create bundles composed of different products to create a new
bundled product. Well-designed product bundles provide convenience and value
to buyers. Adhering to the policies on this page will help Amazon customers
locate product bundles more easily and prevent duplicate or near-duplicate
listings.

##  General bundle policy

  * You may not list bundled products where the primary product in the bundle is from the Video Games category or is a Books, Music, Video, or DVD (BMVD) product.
  * You may include BMVD and Video Games items as secondary products in a bundle if they are related and complementary to the primary product in the bundle. For example, you can list a bundle composed of a yoga mat (the primary product), a yoga DVD, and a yoga book.
    * Bundle pricing must follow the Amazon marketplace fair pricing policy to ensure customer trust. For more information, go to [Amazon Marketplace fair pricing policy](/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V).

  * The referral fee for the primary product's category (the same category used to list the product) applies to the entire bundle.
  * All products in bundles must comply with Amazon's [Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct](/gp/help/1801). More specifically, all products within bundles must adhere to the guidelines for each category. 
  * Bundle images, features, and descriptions must also adhere to Amazon listing policies.
  * **Consumables Bundle Guidelines:** Bundles that include consumables products in the grocery, gourmet food, pet, baby, health and household, personal care, beauty or luxury beauty products categories have stricter bundling policies regardless of which product category the bundle is listed under. Many of these products are ingestible, applied to the skin, or may be used by vulnerable populations such as children and pets. Additionally, these items often have more stringent product handling and storage requirements. Our policies help ensure all products listed in the bundle are authentic and safe to use and consume. Consumables bundles must adhere to the following requirements: 
    * **The bundle must be a product configuration packaged by the original manufacturer or brand.** For example, you can list a bundle of Dawn dish spray and dish spray refills, which was originally packaged by Dawn, but you cannot create your own bundle of Dawn products with gloves and sponges from another manufacturer or brand.
    * **There are two exceptions to this policy:**
      * You have a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from a brand owner or manufacturer granting you permission to reconfigure and repackage their products. All the products must belong to the same brand and the bundle must be branded with the same brand name as the products. To learn more, go to [Letter of Authorization](/help/hub/reference/external/GUF78PCXAMHDY2A6). 
      * When listing a gift item within the gift basket category, these may have products from multiple brands that are physically bundled together for customers in a manner that is appropriate for serving as a gift.

**Note:** This guidance is applicable for consumables products and not the
bundling policy in general.

Examples | Compliant? | Reasons  
---|---|---  
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainer/PBP1.JPG) | Yes | This bundle is a valid configuration (1 dish spray + 5 refills) packaged by the original manufacturer (P&G) for the brand (Dawn).  
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainer/PBP2.JPG) | No | This bundle is not a valid configuration is not packaged by the original manufacturer (P&G) for the brand (Dawn).  
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainer/PBP3.JPG) | No | The bundle configuration is not valid because this configuration is not packaged by the original manufacturer (P&G) for the brand (Dawn).  
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainer/PBP4.JPG) | Yes | This bundle is a valid configuration packaged by the original manufacturer (The Coca-Cola Company) for brands they own (Sprite, Fanta, and Coca-Cola).  
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainer/PBP5.JPG) | No | The bundle configuration is not a valid configuration packaged by any of the manufacturers, such as The Coca-Cola Company or Keurig Dr Pepper.

We do not allow packaging to be merchandised as a unique item in the bundle. In this case, the bundle configuration would need to be packaged by the manufacturers, such as the "The Coca-Cola Company" or "Keurig Dr Pepper".

  * Failure to adhere to the Bundle Policy, including the following Detailed Bundle Guidelines, may result in the removal of any bundled product listing, account suspension, or both. Amazon reserves the right to modify or revoke this policy at any time.

##  Detailed bundle guidelines

**Bundle listing and categorization:**

  * Bundles must consist of items that are complementary (this means items in the bundle enable or enhance the use of other items in the bundle or provide convenience to the buyer by purchasing them together).
  * Bundles are product offerings that consist of two or more different items combined into a single ASIN. Variety packs, packs, kits, and all other similar bundle-type products are all considered as bundles, irrespective of the nomenclature used on the product pages. Virtual bundles are not covered by this policy. To learn more, go to [Virtual product bundles](/gp/help/G87HAE6PMKKM23Z7).
  * A bundle may be listed in a single category only, even if the products comprising the bundle are from multiple categories. If a bundle includes products from multiple categories, it may be listed only in the category of the highest priced item in the bundle. The only exception to this guideline is if the highest priced item is BMVD or Video Games (because bundles may not be listed in these categories). In these cases, the bundle should be listed in the category with the second highest prices item that is not BMVD or Video Games.
  * The bundle must have its own standard product identifier or manufacturer part number. The identifier of any individual product in the bundle may not serve as the identifier for the bundle. Using a UPC from any single product in the bundle to identify the entire bundle may lead to immediate removal of the listing. You are responsible for obtaining a UPC for each bundle you create.
  * Do **not** include generic products in a bundle, as it may mislead customers into thinking the generic product belongs to the same brand as one of the branded products in the bundle. Generic products are identified as items with no brand on the product or packaging (not just widely unrecognized brands).
  * A bundle can be composed of different branded items, however the bundle itself should be branded according to the highest priced item in the bundle.
  * If an item is a multi-pack, such as six pairs of socks, list it as a single product and not as a bundle. See UPCs and Item Package Quantity for Multi-Packs.
  * If an item is a variation of a parent product, list it as a variation within the parent product’s family and not as a bundle. See [About parent-child relationships.](/gp/help/8841)
  * If you match your bundle to an existing bundle listing, the products in your bundle must be exactly the same as the products in the existing bundle. If your bundle is different in any way, you must create a new bundle listing. You may not change the existing listing to align to the specifications of your new bundle.
  * Once you create a bundle, you may not modify the components of that bundle. If you want to add or remove products from the bundle, you must create a new bundle listing with a unique UPC or match to an existing bundle listing that is identical to your revised bundle.

##  Bundle warranties and returns:

  * If you list a product bundle, you must accept the entire bundle as a return and refund it as a single unit.
  * A bundle cannot contain any separate warranty products or extended service plans.

##  Bundle titles:

  * Bundle title length should align to title length rules in Amazon’s listing policy. This policy allows listings with a title length of maximum 200 characters (including spaces) in all U.S. categories.
  * Include the word "Bundle" and the number of items in the bundle in the product title. For example: 

Bundle–3 items: Tote Bag, Knit Scarf and Gloves - Blue

  * If the bundle includes only a few items, list them in the title. For example: 

  
                  **FORMAT**   
[Main Product title] + “Bundle with” + [Bundle Component Product title(s)]  
**EXAMPLES**  
"Kodak EasyShare C143 12MP Digital Camera Bundle with Rechargeable Batteries &
Carrying Case – Blue"

  * If the bundle includes many items, list the primary and secondary items in the title, along with the total number of items in the bundle. In these cases, the entire bundle component information must be listed in the bullet points within the bundle details. 

  
                  **FORMAT**   
[Main Product title] + “Bundle with” + [Bundle Component Summary] + “(#
Items)”  
**EXAMPLES**  
"Yamaha PAC112J Sunburst Guitar Bundle with Bag, Stand and Accessories (11
Items)"

##  Bundle product details and images:

  * Feature Bullet 1 in the detail page for your bundle must state that the product is a bundle of "X" number of items and must identify the products in the bundle. 
  * The description in the detail page for your bundle must state that the product is a bundle and must also identify the products in the bundle (with appropriate designators, such as model number, color, and size).
  * The main image for the bundle must include the specific products in the bundle (and must not include any items that are excluded from the bundle). Images of representative or similar products are not permitted.
