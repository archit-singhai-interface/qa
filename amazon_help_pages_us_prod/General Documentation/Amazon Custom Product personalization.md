**Important:** To access the Amazon Custom tools, you must be approved via
[this application](/customization/manageCustomRegistration), and your listings
must be active.

Product personalization allows customers to build their own product by
uploading their own images, text, or data to areas that you designated for the
product.

To get started, make sure that customization is enabled for your product:  

  1. From the listing page, click the product details tab and select **Yes** for the question **Does your product have customization?**
  2. Enter your custom product details on the customization tab.

You can also access the customization listing page from Manage Inventory. From
the **Edit** drop-down menu for the product, select **Add/edit
customization**.

**Note:** If you donâ€™t see this option, you may not be registered for the
program. To register, go to [Amazon Custom](/gp/help/201757520).

## Image customization

Image customization allows customers to personalize your product by uploading
their own images.

To add image customization to your products, follow these steps:

  1. Enter a label and upload a preview image. Label the surface, for example, "front of shirt" or "back of shirt," then upload the surface preview image. The preview image is the image on which customers will place their customizations. The preview image must be square, with a minimum 400 x 400 pixels in JPEG or PNG format and a maximum size of 3MB.

  2. Optional: Add surfaces, if applicable, by clicking the **Add surface** button. You're allowed up to five surfaces with 10 customizations per surface. Surfaces are available only for select product types.

  3. Optional:   

    1. Enter instructions. You can apply instructions to the overall product and to each individual image customization, for example, "Use a JPG or PNG file with a minimum of 2,000 x 2,000 pixels." All instruction fields are visible to customers and should clearly specify what the customer is personalizing. We recommend entering fewer than three lines of instructional text per instruction field.
    2. Upload a clipping mask. Clipping masks allow you to define areas of your preview that shouldn't be covered by an image that the customer uploads. For example, if you sell a phone case and you masked both the background and camera hole, the image that the customer uploads will appear as if it were perfectly cut in the shape of the case, leaving the background and camera hole intact.

  4. Select **Add customization** to add a customization type. In the pop-up box, select **Image** and click **Add customization**.

  5. Define the image parameters. Customers can see a preview of the image that they upload on your product. To define the parameters and location of the image that your customers will see, follow these steps:    

    1. Specify whether this customization type is required for customers before they add the product to their cart. The default setting is **Required**.
    2. Enter the label and instructions. These are visible to the customer and should clearly specify what the customer is personalizing.
    3. In the box, draw (by clicking or dragging your cursor) or type the coordinates of the position where you would like the customer's image to appear in the preview. The top left corner of the image area is (0, 0). 
    4. Optional: Center the position of the customization preview using the **Vertical** or **Horizontal** buttons. The blue box will realign automatically. 
    5. Optional: Specify a recommended image resolution in pixels. If an uploaded image doesn't meet the minimum pixel size, the customer will get a low-resolution alert with the recommended upload size.

  6. Before publishing your listing, click **Preview** to see an interactive copy of what the customer will see. 

  7. Once you're done entering the necessary information, click **Publish** in the bottom right-hand corner of the page to publish the product to Amazon. This process can take up to 24 hours.

## Text customization

Text customization allows customers to add text to your products using color
and font options that you've specified in Seller Central.

To add text customization to your products, follow these steps:

  1. Enter a label and upload a preview image. Label the surface, for example, "front of shirt" or "back of shirt," then upload the surface preview image. The preview image is the image on which customers will place their customizations. The preview image must be square, with a minimum 400 x 400 pixels in JPEG or PNG format and a maximum size of 3MB. 

  2. Optional:
     * Enter instructions. You can apply instructions to the overall product and each individual text customization, for example, "Use capital letters only." All instruction fields are visible to customers and should clearly specify what the customer is personalizing. We recommend entering fewer than three lines of instructional text per instruction field. 
     * Upload a clipping mask. Clipping masks allow you to define areas of your preview that shouldn't be covered by images that the customer uploads. For example, if you sell a phone case and you masked both the background and camera hole, the image that the customer uploads will appear as if it were perfectly cut in the shape of the case, leaving the background and camera hole intact.

  3. Select **Add customization** to add a customization type. In the pop-up box, select **Text** and click **Add customization**. The text customization lets customers enter the text that they want to appear on a product. 

  4. Select the fonts that your customers can choose from. We provide more than 100 pre-loaded fonts.

  5. Optional: You can add the most popular fonts and font colors by selecting **Add popular font** and **Add popular font colors**. The most popular fonts will be added automatically to the existing list of fonts that you've provided for your listing.

  6. Optional: You can add custom fonts via the **Custom fonts** tab by clicking on or dragging a file to upload it from your device.

**Note:** Font files must be in .ttf (true type font) or .woff (web open font
format) format and must be set to installable. Use lowercase file-type names
when uploading to the font container.

Enter the name for the custom font. This name will be visible to customers.
Click **Add font** and then click **Done**. You can add up to 20 fonts, across
both custom and standard, on one text customization.

  7. Select the font colors that your customers can choose from by using the color picker that we provide. Pick a color, give it a name, and click **Add**. Your new font color will be displayed in a list in the text-customization box. You can add up to 50 font colors.

**Note:** The first color option that is listed in the **Colors added** block
is selected by default for customers. To change the default, use the drag-and-
drop symbol to the left of the color block to reorder the colors.

  8. Customers can see a preview of their customizations based on the text inputs and placement information that you provide. To define the parameters and location of the text that customers will see on the product detail page, follow these steps:   

    1. Specify whether this customization type is required for customers before they add the product to their cart. The default setting is **Required**. Even if you don't specify a field as required, the customer must still enter at least one customization to be able to add the item to their cart.
    2. Enter the label and instructions for the customer, for example, "Use capital letters only." The label and instructions are visible to the customer and should clearly specify what the customer is personalizing.
    3. Enter sample text. The text is visible to the customer and serves as an invitation to customize, for example, "Your name," "Custom text," or "Place text here."
    4. Enter the type of characters allowed. You can restrict the types of characters that customers can enter by selecting a validation type. The following validation types are offered:
       * All characters excluding emojis
       * All characters including emojis
       * Letters and numbers only
       * Numbers only
       * Capital letters only

**Note:** "All characters" includes letters, numbers, and symbols.

    5. Enter a character limit. The limit must be between one and 200 characters. The customer will see a countdown of the character limit that you set for each text customization.
    6. Enter the numbers of lines available for each text field. By selecting more than one line, customers can space or enter text across multiple lines, rather than enter multiple text-customization fields. Currently, only centered justified text is allowed.
    7. In the box, draw (by clicking or dragging your cursor) or type the coordinates of the position where you would like the customer's text to display on your preview image. The top left corner of the image area is (0, 0).
    8. Optional: Center the position of the customization preview using the **Vertical** or **Horizontal** buttons. The blue box will realign automatically. 
    9. **Select an input placement.** You can choose between free placement or static placement. Free placement enables the customer to enter text and move it freely inside the boundary box. Static placement enables the customer to enter text to a fixed area on the product without moving it. 

  9. Before publishing your product, click **Preview** to see an interactive copy of what the customized product will look like on Amazon.

  10. Once you're done entering the necessary information, click **Publish** in the bottom right-hand corner of the page to publish the product to Amazon. This process can take up to 24 hours.
