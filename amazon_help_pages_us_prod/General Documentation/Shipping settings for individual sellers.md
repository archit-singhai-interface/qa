**Note:**

  * This help page does not apply to sellers with professional selling plan
  * Individual sellers can neither update shipping charges nor create shipping template

Amazon will charge buyers a standard shipping amount based on product category
and shipping method selected by the buyer. Once you receive an seller-
fulfilled order you will be credited the amount charged to the buyer for
shipping.

You must ship orders even if the shipping credit is less than your total
shipping costs. For more information, go to [Manage your offers one at a
time](/gp/help/G201186860).

To customize your shipping preferences, go to **Inventory** and select
**Manage all inventory,** locate the **SKU** and click **Edit** , select
**Offer** , and then locate **Shipping Options** and enable your preferred
ship options. Available ship options are Standard, Expedited/Express, One-day,
Two-day, International and International Expedited/Express.

**Note:** Shipping preferences configured on the [Shipping
Settings](/gp/shipping/dispatch.html) page will not have any effect on your
orders. You need to update SKU-level shipping options following the steps
above.

## Frequently asked Questions

**If I enable a shipping preference (for example, Expedited shipping) for a
SKU but have it disabled on account settings, will I receive orders with this
shipping preference?**

Yes, any setting configured for your SKU will apply to your orders. If you
can’t fulfill this order cancel it. This will impact your cancellation rate.

**If I enable a shipping preference (for example, Expedited shipping) on my
account but have it disabled on my SKUs, will I receive orders with this
shipping preference?**

No, your shipping preferences will only apply if they are set per SKU.

**Why do account level shipping settings exist?**

Account-level ship options are used to pre-select the settings for new SKUs.
However, you still need to save these SKU level settings, for them to take
effect.

**What will the 'order promise date' be if I don't set shipping options at SKU
level**

‘Order promise date’ will be based on default shipping settings if you don’t
set it at SKU level

**What happens if the SKUs are not updated?**

Your shipping preferences will only apply on order promise if they are set per
SKU.
