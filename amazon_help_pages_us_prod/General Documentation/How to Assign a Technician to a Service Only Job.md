Technician Assignment is how you assign specific jobs to your technicians.
This feature enables you to keep track of which technician is completing a
job, limits technicians to only see jobs assigned to them, and lets customers
know who will be servicing their order.

Keep in mind that only background check approved technicians can be assigned
to in-home jobs, and technician’s profile must be complete and have a
photo.Otherwise they will not be listed as eligible when assigning the order.

You may assign up to 10 technicians to a service order. If you decide to
assign multiple technicians to you must choose a lead staff member, who will
be responsible for every step in the completion of the order through the
mobile app. Other technicians assigned will be identified as secondary
technicians.

Some services require multiple technicians (e.g. deliveries with services,
room of choice deliveries). Examples of services that may require multiple
technicians include, but are not limited to TV wall mounting with TVs greater
than 50”, large furniture, home gyms or playsets. If you follow the
instructions below and are unable to assign an order(s) to technicians,
contact [Services Central
Operations](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/GU3X5YH9J8MPKD99?language=en_US&ref=ls_GU3X5YH9J8MPKD99_cont_home).

**Important:**

  * You should ensure a technician is assigned 48 hours prior to the job. 
  * All deliveries with services and room of choice deliveries require two (2) technicians.
  * Jobs can be reassigned to any other background checked approved staff member(s) at any time before starting the job. Best practice is to limit the number of reassignments since Customers receive notification updates for each reassignment.
  * Only the assigned technicians should arrive at the Customer’s home.
  * Check the [Best Practices](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/GTP5RCSXC62A7SUG?language=en_US&ref=ls_GTP5RCSXC62A7SUG_cont_home) for service completion for advice on how to manage appointments as a technician.
