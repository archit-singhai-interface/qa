## Steps to appeal an A-to-z Guarantee Claim

Once a Claim is granted to the customer and your account has been debited, you
have 30 calendar days to submit an appeal if an A-to-z Guarantee Claim has
been granted in favor of the customer. This is your opportunity to provide new
information for our investigation to dispute the decision.

To appeal a claim:  

  1. From the **Performance** menu, select [A-to-z Guarantee Claims](/gp/guarantee-claims/home.html/).
  2. Click the **Option to Appeal** tab, find the relevant Claim and select **Appeal decision**.
  3. Follow the appeal instructions and upload proof of delivery or other documentation that supports your reason for appealing.

**Note:** If selecting ''Other'' as an appeal reason, use the text box to
provide any information that may help us better understand why you believe the
original decision was incorrect.

  4. Select **Submit**.

Once you've submitted an appeal, we'll review the information you provided. If
we determine that additional information is required after you submit the
appeal, we'll contact you via email. You must respond to any information
request within 72 hours. For more information on responding to Claim
notifications, go to [Respond to an A-to-z Guarantee Claim](/gp/help/G1781).

**Important:** When you appeal a Claim decision, either the cost of the refund
or the impact to your order defect rate (ODR) may be reversed. It may take up
to 7 calendar days for the ODR reversal to reflect on the Orders page or to
refund your selling account.
