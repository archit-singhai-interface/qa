A special handling fee applies to televisions with screens that are 42 inches
or larger. Screen dimensions are calculated as the diagonal measurement
between opposing corners. Smaller televisions may also incur the special
handling fee because of factors such as weight and fragility. You can see if
this fee will apply in the [Fee Preview
