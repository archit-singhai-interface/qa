## Customization templates

If you are selling multiple products that require the same type of
customization you can avoid having to re-enter the same details manually by
creating and applying templates. Templates can be used to add customizations
to products individually or in bulk.

#### 1\. Create or identify customization to copy

Templates are created using the same page you use to add or edit
customizations. You can start by locating the product in your inventory from
which you want to copy customizations and selecting **Add/edit customization
information**.

#### 2\. Generate template

After adding or editing customization to a product, click **Generate
template** at the bottom right of the page. All customization fields
(including fonts, font colors, labels, etc.) are copied to a template. Name
and save your template and click **Continue** to view all your templates.

#### 3\. Apply a template to a single product

Now that you have saved your template, you can use it to add customizations to
similar products. Locate the product in your inventory to which you want to
add customizations and select **Add/edit customization information**. Choose
the template from which you wish to copy customizations using the **Apply a
template** drop-down.

**Note:** Customization from the template replaces any previous customization
on the product. You can review and verify the customization before publishing
your changes.
