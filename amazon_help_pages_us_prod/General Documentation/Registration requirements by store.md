##  United States  
  
You will need to provide a valid credit card, bank account, phone number, and
tax information. You will also need to go through an online step-by-step
interview that will determine whether you will need to complete a W-9 form (as
a U.S. taxpayer) or a W-8BEN (as a non-U.S. taxpayer). Visit [United States
Tax and Regulatory Considerations](/gp/help/201468390) for more information on
taxes. You might also be required to provide additional documentation such as
scanned copies of a passport, national ID, bank account statement, or credit
card statement.

##  European Marketplaces

You will need to provide a valid credit card, phone number, and tax
information. You will also need to provide a VAT number. Although you can
complete your registration without a VAT number, you will be required to
provide one in order to sell in Europe. To find out how to register for a VAT
number, visit [Europe Tax and Regulatory Considerations](/gp/help/201468410).

**Note:** For additional information about VAT registration and compliance,
see the [VAT Registration in
EU](https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/vat-
resources.html) Services page.

**The Amazon European Marketplaces account**

In Europe, Amazon has unified its marketplaces, allowing you to create and
manage product offers on one or more of the following websites: Amazon.co.uk,
Amazon.fr, Amazon.de, Amazon.it, and Amazon.es. You control what you sell and
where, and you manage your European business from a single seller account.

When you register to sell on any of the Amazon European marketplaces, your
seller account is automatically enabled to allow you to sell on all other
Amazon European marketplaces.All your orders will be managed in a single
place, making selling in Italy feel just like selling in the marketplace where
you originally registered. However, you will still need to satisfy the Amazon
seller rules applicable to the countries where you sell. These are basic rules
to ensure Amazon's customers enjoy the best possible shopping experience.
You'll also need to be aware of the local and European tax and regulatory
requirements, and it's your responsibility to ensure that you comply with
applicable requirements. Please also note that when you sell on any of the
Amazon marketplaces in Europe, you will be subjected to country-specific per-
item fees which are payable to Amazon upon sale of an item.

In order to sell across Europe, you will need to create listings in each of
the Amazon European marketplaces where you want to sell. Please note that
creating offers in the first European marketplace does not automatically
populate offers in the other European marketplaces; you will need to create
offers in each of the marketplaces where you want them. See the [Listing
Creation for Global Accounts](/gp/help/201468480) for more details.

Finally, when setting up an Amazon European seller account, you'll need to
provide a bank account in one of the countries supported by Amazon. Currently,
Amazon supports U.K. and U.S. bank accounts, as well as bank accounts in all
Eurozone countries. Visit the [Eurozone Portal]( https://europa.eu/) for more
information.

##  Japan

Amazon.co.jp offers an [online seller
registration](https://services.amazon.co.jp/services/out-of-
country/en/selling-on-amazon.html) process in English and Japanese. Once you
have set up your account, you'll be able to choose Japanese or English to
manage your account in Seller Central.
