If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

To learn more about our policy relating to dietary supplements, watch our
[webinar](https://register.gotowebinar.com/recording/1478879861866867968) or

## Dietary supplements covered by this policy

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the
manufacturing, packaging, storing, and labeling of dietary supplements under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and its subsequent amending
statutes, including the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.

The FDA defines a dietary ingredient as a vitamin, mineral, herb or other
botanical, amino acid, or dietary substance for use to supplement the diet by
increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite,
constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances intended for
human consumption. Dietary supplements come in different forms such as
powders, pills, capsules, liquid drops, and oral sprays. They include but are
not limited to categories such as vitamins and minerals and herbs and
botanicals; and can be marketed for functions such as sexual enhancement,
weight management, bodybuilding and sports nutrition.

Dietary supplements must not make disease claims or contain undeclared drug
ingredients or articles that are approved as new drugs.

## Our policy for dietary supplements

We require you to verify that dietary supplement products meet our policy via
third-party testing on an annual basis to ensure products offered in our store
meet the following criteria:

  * Products are manufactured in a facility compliant with the FDA's [Current Good Manufacturing Practice](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/current-good-manufacturing-practice-cgmp-regulations) regulations (cGMPs, 21 CFR 111/117 or equivalent)
  * Products do not contain contaminants that may pose a human health or regulatory concern
  * Products contain the ingredients claimed on the product label
  * Products do not contain undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients 
  * Products are labeled according to guidelines set forth by the FDA and do not contain illegal or disease claims

Dietary supplements products identified as being affected by this initiative
can be found within the [Manage Your Compliance](/spx/myc/dashboard)
