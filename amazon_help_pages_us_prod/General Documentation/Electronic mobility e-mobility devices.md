If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## E-mobility devices covered by this policy

An e-mobility device is any small, low-speed, electric-powered transportation
device, including electric-assist bicycles (e-bikes), electric scooters
(e-scooters), and other small, lightweight, wheeled electric-powered
conveyances. This policy does not include e-mobility devices that are intended
for use by children.

**Hoverboard**

A hoverboard, also known as a monorover or self-balancing electric scooter, is
an electronic mobility device that has two wheels and a board, between the two
wheels, that a user stands on. The user moves their feet to direct the
hoverboard to move forwards or backwards.

**Self-balancing unicycles**

A self-balancing unicycle uses sensors in conjunction with an electronic motor
to assist a rider with balancing on a single wheel, and does not have a handle
for the user to grip. The self-balancing unicycle is also known as a single-
wheel scooter or a unicycle scooter.

**Electric skateboards (e-skateboards)**

An electric skateboard has four wheels and has an added battery pack and power
system to aid riders with added torque while traveling. An electric skateboard
may have a handheld remote control to allow the rider to control the device
during use.

**Electric scooters (e-scooters)**

An electrical scooter is an e-mobility device that has two or more wheels, a
low platform, a vertical element for the user to grasp, and a method of
steering. There are several types of electronic scooters, including foldable
scooters, kickstand scooters, and rideable scooters such as mopeds. Electric
scooters have limited range and a maximum speed of less than 40 miles per
hour.

**Self-balancing personal transport devices**

A self-balancing transport device may have one or two wheels. These devices
are powered by a rechargeable battery pack and use the shifting weight of the
rider to balance the device.

**Electrical bicycles (e-bikes or e-bicycles) and electric tricycles (e-trikes
or e-tricycles)**

Electric bicycles and electric tricycles, also called e-bikes and e-trikes,
are electrically assisted pedal bicycles. These are two-wheeled or three-
wheeled e-mobility devices used for personal transportation, with fully
operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 250 watts and top power
speed of 25 kmph (15.5 mph) that provides propulsion assistance.

This policy does not include e-mobility device accessories. Please visit our
policy on [Electronic mobility (e-mobility) device
accessories](/gp/help/external/G7HM69VDEMRW7TPE).
