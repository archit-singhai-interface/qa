**Estimated fee per unit sold** is a tool that provides a preview of the core
fees for Selling on Amazon and Fulfillment by Amazon when a unit is sold of a
specific SKU. You can access this estimate on either the **Manage FBA
Inventory** page or the **Manage Inventory** page in the column titled
**Estimated fee per unit sold**. The fees shown are based on the list price,
estimated shipping cost (where applicable), and available data for the product
in our system. The value is only an estimate and actual costs may vary and do
not include optional fees.

You can search by keyword (ASIN or product name) to find products already
listed on Amazon.

**Tip:** The estimate is based on your current fulfillment method. To view
estimates for an alternative fulfillment method, create a new listing or try

## Frequently asked questions

#### Does estimated fees per unit sold display an estimate for Multi-Channel
Fulfillment offers?

Yes. A fee estimate will be calculated for products participating in the
Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. However, the fee estimate assumes an in
Amazon store sale. If the product is sold on a different channel, then your
final fee will be different from the estimate.
