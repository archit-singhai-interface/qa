Driving awareness and telling your audience you have new merch on Amazon is an
important part of being successful with Collab. Timing and details are the key
factors. To yield positive customer experience, begin promoting to your
audience only when you are ready. Use the below checklist to determine that
you are prepared to let your audience know about your new products.

## How do I know when I am ready to announce the launch of new merch on
Amazon?

  * Store page – You have published your store page and all features are functioning properly on the public site. For more info on store pages, see [Amazon Advertising](https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-stores).
  * Selection - You have at least 25 products populated in your store (recommended).
  * Associates Tag - You have signed up for the Amazon Associates Program (recommended) and have received your Associates Tag. Using your Associates Tag in your promotional efforts will help maximize your earnings and allow you to gain insights into your marketing performance through the Associates reporting tools. For Amazon reporting tools, [sign up here](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/).
  * Refined messaging - You have narrowed down the top three messages you want your audience to know when you announce your new merch (For e.g., new and official store page on Amazon.com, brand new designs,, Amazon Prime benefits). You have developed a clear call to action to include all activations (For e.g., "shop now,” "see more here" or "retweet to win").
  * Marketing materials - You have mocked-up your first set of social media posts featuring your favorite design(s). 

**Note:** When promoting apparel, it’s recommended that black, white, navy,
and dark-heather colors featured due to higher in-stock rates.

  * Educate yourself - You have reviewed our Trademark Usage Guidelines and downloaded the proper Amazon logo to use in your marketing materials if desired. Go to [Trademark Usage Guidelines](/gp/help/200573210) and [Amazon logo](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/AdProductsWebsite/images/ad-specs/AmazonBrandLogos.zip) to learn more.

## Seven ways to help your audience find your listings

  

  1. Create a teaser: Excite your audience and begin building your search ranking by announcing what is coming up on your social channels one week before you officially launch. Don't include any links, but including an Amazon logo in your imagery can be an easy way to get audience talking and searching.
  2. Officially announce your merch on all social channels and websites: Use your dedicated website and social channels to let your audience know about your new merch store. Add a link to your store page in all marketing activations to ensure your audience know where to go to shop.
  3. Update all owned social channels and websites with link to store page: Update your social media bios and website descriptions with a link to your store page. This will help drive steady traffic to your store even on days when you are not posting about it.
  4. Post and share content from your audience: When you see content relating to your merch from your audience, spread the good word to your tribe by reposting their content.
  5. Run Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Product Ads: Help more shoppers discover and buy your merch through pay-per-click Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Product Ads. These ads are useful tools for driving sales and increasing brand awareness. To get started, visit [Advertise on Amazon](https://ams.amazon.com/).
  6. Wear your merch: Wear or use your favorite products in social posts, videos, and at events (even if you are not actively promoting your merch at that time). This is a great way to show your audience you stand behind your designs while driving awareness.
  7. Continue to add selection and maintain awareness: Set a monthly reminder to add 20 new products a month and complete at least one marketing activation per month post-launch to continue to drive awareness, traffic, and sales to your listings.
