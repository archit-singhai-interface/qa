Monitoring seller feedback and performance is essential to your success while
selling on Amazon. To understand and manage seller feedback, open the links
under Seller feedback help pages section below that offers knowledge on how to
handle feedback received from buyers and best practices for identifying and
resolving potential problems that can lead to negative feedback.

#### What is seller feedback?

Seller feedback enables buyers purchasing products from sellers to provide
feedback comments and rating regarding their order experience. Feedback is
provided by buyers from the ‘Orders’ page, by clicking first on the specific
order, followed by the link ‘Leave Seller Feedback’.

**Note:** Buyers can submit only one feedback per order. They have 90 days
from the order date to leave their rating and comments.

#### Why is seller feedback important?

Seller feedback reflects buyers’ experience of the products purchased from
you. It serves as a reference point to take corrective actions on your
fulfillment practices, thereby improving the post-order experience of buyers,
and helps buyers make guided purchasing decisions.

#### What is the difference between a product review and seller feedback?

Product reviews provide a description about the quality of the product, its
function or usefulness. Seller feedback covers the experience provided by the
seller from whom the product has been purchased, in terms of reliability,
quality, and overall fulfilment experience.

Buyers can submit product reviews [here](https://www.amazon.com/review/review-
your-purchases).
