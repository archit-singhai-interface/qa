This page provides information about the first step to create a shipment to be
sent to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD).

## Choose inventory to send

  1. Choose your "**ship from** " address and pick your preferred "**ship to** " region. You can provide your preferred destination region by clicking on "**Change Ship to** " option.

**Important:** The allotment of region will be based on available capacity at
the distribution center during the expected arrival time of your shipment.

  2. To choose inventory to send to AWD, go to our _[Program page](/asdn/about#learn-service)_ and click **Create shipment**. Youâ€™ll then be directed to the Send to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution workflow.

  3. Add inventory by either selecting from a list of your available SKUs or by choosing **File upload** option under SKU selection method.

**Important:** A single shipment can only contain 150 unique SKUs. If you are
shipping using **Amazon Global Selling SEND** you cannot add more than 600
boxes if shipping from China and not more than 2400 boxes if shipping from
Vietnam in a single shipment.

**Important:** The expiration date of the product must be at least 185 days in
the future from the Inbound shipment creation date in order to be eligible for
AWD.

### Add individual units to a workflow

  1. Choose or create a packing template from the drop-down menu in the **Packing details** column. To create a packing template, enter the box configuration, number of units per box, and prep instructions.

A single box can only contain 150 units of a single SKU. However, the seller
can send multiple boxes for the same SKU.

  2. In the **Information/action** column, you can print SKU labels for item labeling. If you want Amazon to label your items for you, you can request that your items be prepped at the destination FBA fulfillment center. Labeling does not occur until after the items have left the AWD DC.

  3. Enter the number of boxes in the **Quantity to send** column.

  4. Click **Ready to send**.

  5. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Confirm and continue** to proceed to the next step of the workflow.

### Add inventory in bulk using template file

  1. Click **Generate and download template** on your right to get your template.

  2. Complete the file with the list of SKUs that you want to send.

**Important:** You cannot upload a file with more than 150 rows.

  3. Upload your completed file.

  4. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Confirm and continue** to proceed to the next step of the workflow.
