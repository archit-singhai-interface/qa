Amazon obsesses over providing our customers the best possible shopping
experience. Since the inception of our store, one way we have ensured a great
customer experience is by sourcing products directly from Brands and selling
them to customers in our store ourselves. In order to preserve that customer
experience, we may choose to source products from some Brands for sale by
Amazon only. Other Brands can operate as sellers in the Amazon store if they
can consistently maintain our standards for customer experience. However, to
prevent customer confusion, if any of the Brandâ€™s products are sold by Amazon
via Amazon retail, the Brand may not sell those products via Seller Central in
the Amazon store.

We measure customer experience in a number of ways, including high in-stock
rates, delivery experience, price competitiveness, and selection completeness.
We offer several tools and services to help you meet our standards and sell
successfully in the Amazon store, including tools for inventory management and
automated pricing, fulfillment services like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), and
services to grow and protect your Brand like Brand Registry.

If you are unable to maintain our standards for customer experience, you might
lose certain privileges associated with operating as a seller in the Amazon
store (including having your offers featured on product detail pages), or you
might lose the opportunity to operate as a seller in the Amazon store
altogether. In that case, you can still offer to sell your products to Amazon
so that your products can be sold through Amazon retail
