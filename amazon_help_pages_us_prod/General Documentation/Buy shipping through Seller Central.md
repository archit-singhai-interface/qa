##  Buy shipping

On the [Manage Orders](/gp/orders-v2) page, you can buy shipping either from
the list view or from the order details.

From your seller account, go to **Orders** > **Manage Orders** , and then
click the **Buy shipping** button for the order you want to ship. You can also
access the **Buy shipping** button from the **Order details** page by clicking
the order number.

There will be four columns of information on the **Buy Shipping** page:

  

  1. The first column verifies the **Customer ship option** , the **Ship to** address, and the purchased **Items in this package**. This information is automatically populated when the buyer purchases an item. If shipping internationally, you will need to enter weights and descriptions of each item in this column by clicking the link under each item.
  2. The second column houses the **Ship from** location, **Ship date** , **Packaging** dimensions, and **Weight**. Use the package dimensions of the outer-most shipping container, and weigh the package with all packing materials included. When you ship an item for the first time, we store the package size and weight. The next time you ship the item, the size and weight will automatically pre-populate.

**Note:** Sometimes our systems will associate a higher weight with a product
than the weight you provide for that product. If this happens, you will see a
warning about the weight you entered for a package. Confirm that the weight
you entered is correct before proceeding. To learn how to submit product
information corrections, see [There is a mistake on a product detail page. How
can I correct it?](/gp/help/26571)

  3. In the third column, select a shipping service, any optional services, and the label print orientation (if offered). If you've configured your [Buy Shipping preferences](/gp/help/202086070) ahead of time, your shipping services and optional services will be automatically selected according to the available services, your preferences, and the lowest available cost. If the shipping service you have chosen offers the option to change label print orientation, you can change this at the bottom of the third column. This setting will be automatically stored and pre-populated for shipping services that offer this option. You can enter or update your Buy Shipping preferences by clicking the link at the bottom of the Buy Shipping page.

**Note:** To view all available shipping services, on the **Buy Shipping**
page, click the **See all options** link. The options will differ depending on
the carrier.

  4. The fourth column verifies the **Delivery date** , **Total delivery charge** , and any shipping service requirements. To view detailed charges, click the **See Details** link. When you are ready to purchase the shipping label, click **Buy shipping**.

If you need information about return labels instead of shipping labels, see
[Manage returns](/gp/help/200708210).

The following browsers are supported and are required to print shipping labels
successfully through Buy Shipping:

  * Chrome (latest version)
  * Firefox (ESR 38 and above)
  * Internet Explorer 11, latest version
  * Safari (latest, versions 5.1, 6, and 7 as of May 2014)

## Packages with multiple parts

**Buy Shipping** does not support the use of different packages for separate
parts of one product. It is not possible to buy separate shipping with
different labels and tracking numbers for individual parts or pieces of one
product listing.
