An Archived Orders Report is a tab-delimited text file that lists all products
that were sold during a specified period. Archived orders do not contain
buyersâ€™ personally identifiable information such as their name, phone number,
address, or gift message.

The report displays information for orders you have received during the year
and month you select, including those you have canceled or confirmed as
shipped. All types of seller orders, both seller-fulfilled and fulfillment by
Amazon (FBA), are included in this report.

For information about reports for newer orders, go to [All Orders
Report](/gp/help/200547170).
