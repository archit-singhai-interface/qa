For eligible products that require a barcode label, you can have Amazon apply
those barcode labels for you for a per-item fee.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for the FBA Label Service, products must meet the following
requirements:

  * **Condition** : Any (new, used, collectible, refurbished) 
  * **Product type** : Any (media and non-media) 
  * Not prohibited, [restricted](/gp/help/200140860), or high-value
  * Have a single scannable barcode (GCID, UPC, EAN, JAN, or ISBN) that corresponds to an ASIN in Amazon’s catalog.

**Note:** GCIDs can no longer be used in place of a UPC, EAN, JAN, or ISBN to
create ASINs. If your brand has been approved for [Amazon Brand
Registry](/gp/help/G202130410) and you don’t have UPCs, EANs, JANs, or ISBNs
for your products, you can apply for a [GTIN exemption](/gp/help/G200426310)

**Important:** If the product doesn’t have a manufacturer barcode or
[Transparency](https://brandservices.amazon.com/transparency) barcode, an
Amazon barcode label must be applied to the item.

Amazon will, at our sole discretion, determine which products meet the
eligibility requirements for the FBA Label Service. We reserve the right to
disqualify products from this service that otherwise meet the above
requirements.

##  Terms and conditions

By enabling the FBA label service, you agree to allow Amazon to apply barcode
labels to your eligible inventory in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:

  * We will apply Amazon barcodes to your eligible items upon arrival at the fulfillment center using the product information that you provide.
  * You will be charged a $0.55 per-item fee.
  * You can choose to apply barcode labels to individual products yourself by selecting **Merchant** under **Who labels** during the shipment creation process.
  * We may instruct you to divide shipments so that items destined for the FBA label service are packed together.
  * Shipments directed to the FBA label service may be further divided into multiple shipments.

For products that do not qualify for the FBA Label Service, you are
responsible for applying any required Amazon barcodes. For more information,
go to [Use an Amazon barcode to track inventory](/gp/help/200141490).

For eligible products, you can use virtual tracking with the manufacturer
barcode. For more information, go to [Using FBA virtual
tracking](/gp/help/200141480).

## How to change your FBA Label Service option

You can change your FBA Label Service option in your Fulfillment by Amazon
settings.

  1. In the **Settings** drop-down menu, select **Fulfillment by Amazon**.   

  2. In the **Optional services** section, click **Edit**.
