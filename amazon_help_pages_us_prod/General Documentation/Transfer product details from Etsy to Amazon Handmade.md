**Note:** If you want to sell products in different categories, such as Baby
and Pet Supplies, you will want to create separate templates for each product
type.

  4. Under **Step 2: Select marketplaces** , select the marketplaces where you would like to list your products.

  5. Under **Step 3: Select the type of template** :   

    1. For **Template Language** , select the template language of your choice .

  9. Update your saved template with the following information that is not populated in your CSV file from Etsy:   

    1. **Product Type** : This will not auto-populate in the template field, but there is a drop-down selector where the product type you selected in the generation of your inventory file.
    2. **Seller SKU** : SKU or Stock Keeping Unit is defined by you and can be any combination of alpha-number characters.
    3. **Sub Category** : This will not auto-populate in the template field, but there is a drop-down selector where the product type you selected in the generation of your inventory file.

**Note:** Depending on the Product Type selected for your template, additional
details may be required. Those additional required details will display in the
template using the same color as Product Type, Seller SKU, and Sub Category.

  10. Navigate back to **Add Products via Upload** and select the **Upload your Inventory File** tab. Follow instructions on screen to upload your inventory file template.
