  * Share listing information and manage your inventory consistently across multiple European marketplaces.
  * Keep track of orders on multiple European sales channels in **Manage Orders** or with one combined Order report.
  * Use Fulfillment by Amazon in your source marketplace as a logistics hub, allowing Amazon to serve all your customers through our European Fulfillment Network.
  * Pay a single monthly Pro Merchant subscription fee for your Amazon Europe Marketplaces account.
  * Update or share account information through a consolidated user interface.

**Important:** Providing customer service in the official local language of

If you are ready to sell in Amazon Europe Marketplaces, visit the [Sell
Globally Dashboard](/global-selling/dashboard/?linkTab=EU) or [Expand to
Europe](https://sell.amazon.com/global-selling/europe.html) to get started.

**Note:** If you are already managing Fulfillment by Amazon inventory across
multiple European accounts (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, or
the Netherlands), and want to manage your inventory from a single account, you
can sell through your existing inventory in each European account and then
relist and replenish inventory in your preferred source account.

**Example:** If you sell in the UK, Germany, and France, you can stop
replenishing inventory in Germany and France until the stock is sold out. Then
relist and replenish the inventory through your UK account.

If you have additional questions regarding transferring inventory please
contact Seller Support.
