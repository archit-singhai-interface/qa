[Manage Orders](/gp/orders-v2/list) page provides you a customizable view of
all your orders received through all sales channels. You can view all
Unshipped, Pending, Shipped, and Canceled orders within a given date range or
use **Search** to filter specific types of orders. To visit the page from your
seller account, click **Orders** , then click **Manage Orders**. Sellers with
professional selling plans can also download **Order reports** to view their
sales for a particular time frame.

## Monitor new orders

**Manage Orders** provides up-to-the-minute view of orders. Once we have
verified the buyer's payment method, you can see your orders, including
shipping information, on the **Manage Orders** page. We recommend checking
your seller account for new orders at least once a day.

If you have email order notifications enabled in your **Notification
Preferences** , under **Settings** menu in Seller Central, Amazon Payments
will also send you a notice every time a new order is placed. In case you are
no longer receiving order notification emails, verify that:

  * Email order notifications are enabled in your **Notification Preferences**.
  * You have received new orders since the emails stopped coming.
  * Any firewall or anti-spam software you have installed is not blocking order notification emails.

## Number of items in a single order

The number of items that can be added into one order is limited by buyer
Shopping Cart capacity. Buyer **Shopping Carts** can hold up to 1000 items
combined for all unique items in cart. A cart can have 50 unique items. For
example, a buyer can buy 2 items with quantities of 500 each or 50 items with
a quantity of 20 each in one order. If an order has 1 item only, the quantity
can be up to 999.

## Check missing orders

Use the **Manage Orders** page to search for the missing order. If the order
appears in search results, make note of the purchase date and review your
order reports for that date. If the order is missing from your order reports
or does not show up in search results, contact Selling Partner Support and
reference the missing order number.

## Additional information

Here is some additional information about managing your orders:

  * You must confirm shipment of the order with Amazon within 7 business days of the ship date. Otherwise, Amazon will automatically cancel the order and you will not be paid, even if you shipped the order. One week before the 7-day cutoff, you will see a warning in **Manage Orders** ("Confirm as shipped by [date] to avoid cancellation"), and you will receive a notification by email.
  * When you confirm shipment for even one item in an order, we charge the buyer for the entire order. If the entire order is not confirmed, you will see the "Shipment is late" status in **Manage Orders** , along with a warning message on your seller account home page. This will happen even if you have refunded the remaining items in the order.
  * For orders that are fulfilled by Amazon, you will not see buyers' phone numbers. For more information, go to [Contact a buyer using Buyer-Seller Messages](/help/hub/reference/GTV8NTY5RM6N9LUN). 
  * For seller-fulfilled orders, we provide you with a phone number that connects to the buyer during the fulfillment period. After delivery is complete, this phone number will no longer be valid. For more information, go to [Selling policies and seller code of conduct](/help/hub/reference/G1801).
