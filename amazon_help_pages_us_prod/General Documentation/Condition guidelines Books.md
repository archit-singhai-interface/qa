##

In addition to the general [condition guidelines](/gp/help/G200339950), apply
the following guidelines to new and used books:

  * **New:** A brand-new copy with cover and original protective wrapping intact. Books with markings of any kind on the cover or pages, books marked as "Bargain" or "Remainder," or with any other labels attached may not be listed as New condition.
  * **Used - Like New:** Item may have minor cosmetic defects (such as marks, wears, cuts, bends, or crushes) on the cover, spine, pages, or dust cover. Dust cover is intact and pages are clean and not marred by notes. Item may contain remainder marks on outside edges. Item may be missing bundled media.
  * **Used - Very Good:** Item may have minor cosmetic defects (such as marks, wears, cuts, bends, or crushes) on the cover, spine, pages, or dust cover. Shrink wrap, dust covers, or boxed set case may be missing. Item may contain remainder marks on outside edges, which should be noted in listing comments. Item may be missing bundled media.
  * **Used - Good:** All pages and cover are intact (including the dust cover, if applicable). Spine may show signs of wear. Pages may include limited notes and highlighting.

  * **Used - Acceptable:** All pages and the cover are intact, but shrink wrap, dust covers, or boxed set case may be missing. Pages may include limited notes, highlighting, or minor water damage but the text is readable. Item may be missing bundled media.
  * **Unacceptable** : Has missing pages and obscured or unreadable text. We also do not permit the sale of advance reading copies, including uncorrected proofs, of in-print or not-yet-published books.

##  Collectible

To be considered collectible, a book should be unique in a way that could
reasonably be assumed to increase the book's value to a collector:

  * First editions and first printings
  * Signed, inscribed, or scarce copies
  * Advance reading copies and uncorrected proofs of out-of-print books

Collectible books do not include the following:

  * Uncorrected proofs of in-print or not-yet-published books 
  * Former library books
  * Remaindered books
  * Book club editions

The General Condition Guidelines do not apply to collectible books. The
following conditions apply for Collectible Books:

  * **Collectible - Like New:** All pages and the cover are intact. The dust jacket is intact, if applicable, with no noticeable or very minor nicks or flaws. Spine has no signs of creasing. Book may have very small but virtually unnoticeable flaws.
  * **Collectible - Very Good:** Pages are intact and not marred by notes or highlighting. Spine shows no sign of creasing. Dust jacket, if applicable, shows signs of some rubbing or chipping.
  * **Collectible - Good:** All pages and the cover are intact, including the dust jacket, if applicable. Spine may show signs of wear. Generally, books in Good condition are not considered to be collectible grade.
  * **Collectible - Acceptable:** A readable copy showing significant wear. Dust jacket may be missing. For all but the rarest items, books in Acceptable condition are not considered to be collectible grade.
