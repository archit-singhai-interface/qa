Typically, changes you make to product information appear on your page within
five minutes. However, some updates can take up to six hours. Product
descriptions that are longer than 500 characters are typically updated at 8:00
a.m. (Pacific Standard Time) the following day. However, images may take up to
24 hours to appear on a product detail page.

To edit product details for an existing listing, do the following:

  1. On the **Inventory** menu, select **Manage All Inventory**.

  2. Select the **Active** status filter above the product list.

  3. Find the listing you want to edit, and select **Edit** from the drop-down menu in the same row. A new page opens to update your information.

  4. Update the **Offer** details for that listing, such as Your Price, Restock Date, and Quantity.

  5. Scroll to the bottom and click **Save and finish**.
