Before listing products for Fulfillment by Amazon, it's important to know what
is suitable for our fulfillment process and what is unsuitable. Be sure to
review all sections below for additional product requirements and
restrictions.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal,
disposal or return of inventory upon reception at the Amazon fulfillment
center, the blocking of future shipments to the Amazon fulfillment centers,
charges for preparation or for noncompliance, the deactivation of your selling
account, or fines.

## FBA product requirements and restrictions

Certain products may be eligible for sale on Amazon, but are not eligible for
Fulfillment by Amazon. FBA products must also adhere to specific expiration
date and temperature-sensitive product requirements to be eligible for FBA.
