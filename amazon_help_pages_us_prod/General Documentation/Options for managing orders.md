You have several options for managing orders depending on the number of orders
you receive and your familiarity with Amazon SP-API requests.

####  [ Manage Orders tool](/gp/orders-v2/list)

See a list of your orders, and view details about a selected order, such as
the product, buyer, and shipping information. You can also perform order-
related tasks such as print packing slips and issue refunds.

####  [ Order Reports](/gp/help/651)

Receive order fulfillment information for multiple orders by running a single
report. You can schedule order reports to run automatically or you can run one
at a time.
