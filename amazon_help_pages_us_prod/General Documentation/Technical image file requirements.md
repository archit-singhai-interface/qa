Every product on Amazon must have a main image. We recommend having at least
six images and one video of the product. We prefer images to be larger than
1,000 pixels on the longest side to allow for zoom. We also recommend that you
upload images in the JPEG file format.

The image must meet the following technical requirements:

  * File format should be JPEG (.jpg or .jpeg), TIFF (.tif), PNG (.png), or non-animated GIF (.gif) file formats (JPEG recommended).
  * Color should be RGB or CMYK (RGB is preferred because CMYK color sometimes shows color-tonal variations when displayed on our website). Go to the **Image color** section below.
  * Images must be clear, unpixellated, and have no jagged edges.
  * Resolution should be at least 72 dpi. Images should be 1,000 pixels or larger on the longest side. This minimum size requirement enables the zoom function on the website.
  * Files cannot exceed 10,000 pixels on the longest side.

Most image-editing software includes a function that indicates and lets you
change the pixel dimensions. If you do not have image-editing software, but
the image will display in a browser, you may be able to right-click and view
the image properties to indicate the pixel dimensions.

For the best results, submit your images with minimal or no compression.
Resizing small images to be larger reduces the quality of the image.

For JPEG images, save at the highest possible quality level and avoid re-
saving the image in JPEG format while you edit the image. For TIFF files, do
not apply any file compression. Remove layers from all images before you
submit.

Our servers can only accept images that are formatted to our specifications.
We reserve the right to reject images that do not meet our content standards,
even if the images meet the technical formatting specifications.

We do NOT accept images submitted in the following formats: | We do NOT accept file formats that are proprietary to a specific software application, including, but not limited to, the following:

  * EPS (encapsulated postscript file)

## Image Color

Our customers use a wide variety of displays that render colors differently.
It is likely that colors you see on your screen are different from what
someone else sees. To ensure that your images display accurately, follow our
image color specifications.

Color mode | Description | Accepted?  
---|---|---  
RGB | RGB is the color mode native to the web and most color screen displays. RGB stands for red, green, and blue. These three colors displayed at varying levels of intensity create over 16 million colors. The RGB color space is used for product images. | Yes  
CMYK | CMYK tends to show color tonal variations when displayed on a website, since this color mode is designated for printed materials, not web display. | Not preferred. Use RGB instead.  
Grayscale | Grayscale is a color mode that is used both in print and on the web. The grayscale color space uses 256 shades of grey to create images. | The grayscale color mode can be used for images on the product detail page only when it accurately depicts the color of gray or silver metal products.  
  
## Color profiles and color display

ICC color profiles are a type of data stored in an image to indicate how
electronic equipment interprets color data. These are useful in the printing
industry to ensure color accuracy, but are not commonly used for web display.

Images that rely on a specific color profile for accurate color display may
not appear as intended on Amazon.

To ensure color accuracy, submit files that use the RGB or working color
format. To convert your image profile to RGB or Working RGB you must have
image-editing software that has that capability.
