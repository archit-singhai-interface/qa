If you no longer sell a product, you can make it inactive by closing the
listing or permanently deleting it from your Seller Central account.

##  Close listing

From the **Manage All Inventory** page, locate your product listing, click the
**Edit** drop-down menu on the right, and then select **Close listing**. This
will change the status of the listing to **Inactive**.

You can close multiple listings at the same time by checking the box to the
left of each product listing. Then select **Close listing** from the
**Action** drop-down menu at the top of the page.

When you close a listing, your product will no longer be available for sale on
Amazon, but you will retain your sales history. You can relist the product at
any time.

##  Delete product and listing

From the **Manage All Inventory** page, locate your product listing, click the
**Edit** drop-down menu on the right, and then select **Delete product and
listing**.

You can delete multiple listings at the same time by checking the box to the
left of each product listing. After this, select **Delete product and
listing** from the **Action** drop-down menu at the top of the page.

**Important:** Deleting a listing is permanent. If you want to offer the
listing again, you must wait 24 hours before you can add it.
