If you create a Professional selling plan account, a monthly subscription of
$39.99 is part of the standard [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/help/1791) that you agree to. Please refer to the terms of your
agreement for more information.

You will find more information about fees in the [Selling on Amazon Fee
Schedule](/gp/help/200336920).

If you would like to sell on Amazon without the monthly fee, you can switch
your selling plan to Individual and instead pay a fixed per-item fee when the
item sells.
