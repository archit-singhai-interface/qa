A scheduled **Order Report** contains only new orders received since the last
scheduled report.  
  
By default, the **Order Report** runs automatically every 24 hours after 11:00
p.m. Pacific time. You can reschedule it to run more often or at a more
convenient time. Your settings are displayed in the **Scheduled Report
Settings** section on the [Order Reports](/order-reports-and-
feeds/reports/newOrders) page.

**Note:** Sellers who receive scheduled Orders Reports via XML cannot schedule
a text-file Order Report.

  1. From the **Orders** menu, select [Order Reports](/order-reports-and-feeds/reports/newOrders) and click **New Orders** tab.

  2. Under **Scheduled Report Settings** , review your current settings. If you are not currently receiving scheduled reports, this section will contain the message, "You are not currently receiving scheduled order reports." 

  3. To schedule reports or change your current settings, click **Edit**.

  4. Modify your current schedule or create a new schedule and click **Schedule**.
