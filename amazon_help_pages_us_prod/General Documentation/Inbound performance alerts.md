Alerts display as banners on both your Seller Central homepage and in your
[Shipping queue](/gp/fba/inbound-
queue/index.html?language=en_US&ref=ag_xx_cont_G201265330).

If you send us a shipment or product that does not comply with our shipping
requirements, we typically send you an inbound performance alert, and we may
suspend your ability to send additional shipments of affected products until
you resolve the issues.

#### Inbound performance alert: product-related

When there are ASIN-related problems, we suspend the ability to include that
ASIN in new shipments until you have resolved the problem. You will still be
able to create shipments for other ASINs.
