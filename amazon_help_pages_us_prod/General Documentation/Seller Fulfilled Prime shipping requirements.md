When you enable a shipping template for Seller Fulfilled Prime, the template
will automatically configure the default minimum settings, including removing
the Expedited Shipping option and requiring free Standard Shipping to the
contiguous United States (the lower 48 states and the District of Columbia).
You can also add optional shipping options such as Free Economy or
International shipping or edit certain seller-set ship rates.  
  
**Note:** You are responsible for configuring Prime shipping templates that
meet the delivery speed requirements as defined for each size tier. The
delivery speed metric is the speed displayed to Prime customers when they
visit a detail page where your offer is featured. Your configured same-day,
one-day, and two-day delivery regions are one component of the delivery speed
the Prime customer will see. The other components include order cut-off times,
seller weekend operations, carrier weekend operations, and holidays. For more
information, go to [Seller Fulfilled Prime performance
requirements](/gp/help/G202072550).

The following table summarizes the shipping options that are available on
Prime-enabled shipping templates, including the shipping cost settings, Prime
branding eligibility, and seller configuration options.

Shipping option | Prime customers shipping fee | Non-Prime customers shipping fee | Prime branded eligible | Configuration options  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Same-Day Delivery – Contiguous US** (Same day) | Free | Seller-set rates | Yes | **Optional,** but can help your delivery speed performance.  
**One-Day Delivery – Contiguous US** (1 transit day) | Free | Seller-set rates | Yes | **As required** to meet delivery speed requirements by size tier.  
**Two-Day Delivery – Contiguous US** (2 transit days) | Free | Seller-set rates | Yes | **As required** to meet delivery speed requirements by size tier.  
**Standard Shipping – Contiguous US** (2-4 transit days) | Free | Free | Yes | **Required** for both Prime and non-Prime customers.  
**Standard Shipping – Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico** (5-8 transit days) | Free | Seller-set rates | Yes | **Optional.** If enabled as Prime delivery regions, the transit time is fixed to 5-8 days. These regions will be counted toward your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance (with the exception of delivery speed).  
**Standard Shipping– Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico** (2-14 transit days) | Seller-set rates | Seller-set rates | No | **Optional.** If enabled as non-Prime delivery regions, these regions will not be eligible for Prime branding and will not count toward your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance.  
**Standard Shipping– US Protectorates, APO/FPO** (5-28 transit days) | Seller-set rates | Seller-set rates | No | **Optional.** If enabled for delivery, these regions will not be eligible for Prime branding and will not be counted toward your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance.  
**Free Economy - Contiguous US, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, US Protectorates, APO/FPO** (3-10 transit days) | Free | Free | No | **Optional.** If enabled for delivery, these regions will not be eligible for Prime branding and will not be counted toward your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance, unless the region also exists in a Prime-eligible shipping option listed above.  
**Expedited shipping – international** (1-5 transit days) | Seller-set rates | Seller-set rates | No | **Optional.** If enabled for delivery, these regions will not be eligible for Prime branding and will not be counted toward your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance.  
**Standard shipping – international** (2-28 transit days) | Seller-set rates | Seller-set rates | No | **Optional.** If enabled for delivery, these regions will not be eligible for Prime branding and will not be counted toward your Seller Fulfilled Prime performance.  
  
**Note:** Same-day delivery is only available to sellers who previously
requested access to this shipping option. We appreciate your patience as we
work to roll out this shipping option on Prime templates for all enrolled
Seller Fulfilled Prime sellers.

## Nationwide delivery coverage requirement

All Seller Fulfilled Prime offers require nationwide standard shipping to
Prime and non-Prime customers in the contiguous US (the lower 48 states and
the District of Columbia). These offers are eligible for Prime branding, and
Prime customer detail page views that occur when these offers are featured
will count toward your delivery speed calculation.

**Note:** When a Prime customer views your offer with a standard shipping
option in the contiguous US, this will not be included in the numerator count
for ≤ 1 day or ≤ 2 day speeds but will be counted in the denominator. This is
because the standard shipping option uses 1 day of handling time and 2-4 days
of transit time, so the Prime customer will always see a delivery > 2 days.
Due to this, we suggest that you minimize the regions that are covered by the
standard shipping option in the contiguous US to improve your delivery speed
performance. Learn more at [Seller Fulfilled Prime performance
requirements](/gp/help/G202072550).

## Non-premium shipping options for Prime offers

When a customer’s order has Standard or Free Economy shipping for a product
that is assigned to a Prime shipping template, the handling time (fulfillment
latency) will be set to one operating day, regardless of the time of day when
the order is placed. This means that any default handling time (or SKU-level
handling time if present) you have set, that is greater than one day, will be
ignored for products associated to Prime shipping templates. This includes
when shipping to non-Prime regions.

However, if you set your default handling time (or SKU-level handling time if
present) to same day (that is, 0 days of handling) then the non-premium
shipping options will be expected to ship same-day if received before your
order cut-off time.

To learn more about handling time settings, go to [Manage your handling
time](/gp/help/G200955560).

## Order cut-off times and operational hours

Seller Fulfilled Prime orders where the customer receives same-day, one-day,
or two-day delivery are expected to ship on the day the order is received
during operating days (Monday–Friday and Saturday and/or Sunday), as long as
the customer places the order before your cut-off time. Orders received after
the cut-off time will be promised to ship the next operating day.

As noted above in the section "Non-premium shipping options for Prime offers,"
when the customer’s order has Standard Shipping or Free Economy it will be
promised to ship on the same-day if a 0-day default handling time (or SKU-
level handling time if present) is configured. Otherwise, they will be
promised to ship on the next operating day.
