The budget you set for your coupon is shared with the following costs:

  * USD equivalent to the discount you offer to the customers.
  * Redemption fees ($0.60 for every redemption) charged by Amazon.

For example, if you offer a $4.00 coupon on a $25.00 product. The first day
your coupon becomes active, 50 customers redeem the coupon (buy a coupon-
eligible product after clipping the coupon). The cost for these transactions
are calculated as follows:

(USD equivalent to the discount you offer x number of redemptions) +
(redemption fees x number of redemptions)

($4.00 x 50) + ($0.60 x 50) = $200 + $30 = $230

Your budget is depleted by $230 the following day as a result of this customer
interest in your coupon.

**Important:** We will take your coupon offline when the budget is 80%
utilized, and allocate the remaining 20% to cover for possible redemptions
from customers who have already clipped the coupon. For customers to have the
best experience with coupons, we allow them to redeem coupons for a window of
approximately 30 minutes after we disable the discovery of a coupon (it is 5
minutes in Japan). If 20% of your budget does not cover the customer
redemptions in the 30-minute window (it is 5 minutes in Japan), you will see
the spend exceed your budget.
