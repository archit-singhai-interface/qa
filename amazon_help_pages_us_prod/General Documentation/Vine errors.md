After you complete an enrollment under Amazon Vine program, we will surface
any errors with your enrollment directly in the Vine dashboard. Any time an
enrollment has an action required, we will bring it to the top of your
dashboard for you to take appropriate action as quickly as possible.

Common errors are:

  * **Too many reviews** : Occurs when the enrolled product reaches the 30 reviews limit to make it eligible for Vine. At this point we will stop offering the product to Vine Voices. You do not have to take any action and your enrollment will automatically be concluded.
  * **No FBA offer** : Occurs when the SKU lost its FBA offer. You can fix it by converting your offer to FBA again.
  * **No image** : Occurs when the product does not have a compliant image. You can fix it by uploading a new high-quality image to your listing.
  * **Associate SKU with your brand** : Occurs when the SKU is not associated with a brand that you are the registered agent for in Brand Registry. For more information on how to associate your SKUs with your brand, go to [Brand Registry](/gp/help/G200955930).
  * **Not associated with the enrolled parent** : The enrolled product is no longer part of the same product variation family. To fix this, cancel your enrollment and re-enroll the product family.
  * **Heavy and bulky:** Heavy and bulky items are not eligible for Vine. For any store, items must not be classified as Heavy Bulky to be eligible for Vine (see [this page](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Heavy_bulky/System_Logic) for more information on Heavy Bulky classification).
