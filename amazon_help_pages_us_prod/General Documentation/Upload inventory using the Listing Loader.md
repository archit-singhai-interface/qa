The Listing Loader is a template for uploading your inventory on Amazon for
products that already exist in the Amazon catalog. The Listing Loader lets you
provide listing attributes without product attributes, which are required when
using inventory file uploads.

**Note:** For products that do not exist in the Amazon catalog, first add the
products using [Add one product at a time](/gp/help/G200220550). If products
are not found, see [Use the Listing Loader](/gp/help/G201584910) for more
information.

For additional information, refer to [Listing Loader
overview](/gp/help/G200231900).

**Note:** Download the [Listing Loader template](https://seller-
templates.s3.amazonaws.com/xlsx/US/Flat.File.ListingLoader.us.xlsx). The
Listing Loader is similar to the [Inventory Loader template](https://seller-
templates.s3.amazonaws.com/xlsx/US/Flat.File.InventoryLoader.us.xlsx). We
recommend the Inventory Loader for basic product matching. However, when
multiple matches are found for a product, the Listing Loader might help you
resolve the issue more easily. Refer to [Upload products using the Inventory
Loader template](/gp/help/G201576540) for additional information.

## Search for products and download a pre-filled template

You can search for products that already exist in the Amazon catalog and then
list them using a pre-filled template. Minimal product details are required.

Follow these steps to list your products:  

  1. Select **Catalog** from the Seller Central drop-down menu, and then select **[Add products via upload](/listing/cards)**. Click the **List products already in Amazon's catalog** card to search using product IDs.
  2. You can search for products using UPCs, EANs, ISBNs, or ASINs. You can enter multiple product IDs separated by a comma, space, or line break. Up to 500 products can be searched at once.
  3. After you click **Generate spreadsheet** , you'll be presented with a pre-filled spreadsheet under the **Downloads template** tab. This will have the details of products that you've searched. Verify the products you want to sell and follow these steps:   

    1. If the returned result matches to the product you want to sell, add your offer details and the following information to the corresponding columns in the template:
       * Price 
       * Quantity 
       * Condition
       * Shipping options 
       * Any other optional columns that you want to provide
    2. Repeat the above step for all products in your list. If you don't want to add a particular product, you can either remove it from the list or change the **Action** for the template row to **Ignored**.
    3. Upload the completed spreadsheet in the [Upload your spreadsheet tab](/listing/upload). You can check the processing summary for your SKUs in the [Status](/listing/status) tab. 

If you are unable to locate your product in the list, you can [download a
product template](/cards/add-product) and create new products by providing
product attributes.
