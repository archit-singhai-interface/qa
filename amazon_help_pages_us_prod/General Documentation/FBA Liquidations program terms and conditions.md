These terms and conditions supplement the [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/help/G1791) and govern your participation in the FBA
Liquidations program (the “Program”). By creating a liquidation request, you
agree to these terms and conditions.

  

  1. **Participation.** Your participation in the Program is subject to Amazon’s approval. Amazon may change Program eligibility criteria from time to time.
  2. **Eligible Items.** Only items not excluded in the “Product eligibility” section of the [Help Page](/gp/help/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF) are eligible for the Program ("Eligible Items"). Amazon may change eligibility criteria from time to time by updating the description of Eligible Items on the [Help Page](/gp/help/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF).
  3. **Selecting items for liquidation.** You will submit only Eligible Items for liquidation using the process described on the [Help Page](/gp/help/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF). Amazon will not process liquidation requests for items that are not Eligible Items. Once you submit a liquidation request, you can't cancel it. You may not submit more than one liquidation request for the same item.
  4. **Liquidation.** Amazon will attempt to arrange a buyer for the Eligible Items that you submit for liquidation within 30 days of your submission (the "Liquidation Facilitation Period"). If Amazon is able to find a buyer for your Eligible Items within the Liquidation Facilitation Period, we will transfer the amount that buyer pays for these items to your seller account within 60 days after we receive the buyer's payment. If Amazon is unable to find a buyer for your Eligible Items within the Liquidation Facilitation Period, we will return them to your inventory and you may elect to have us dispose of them on your behalf for a fee or return them to you for a fee. You acknowledge and agree that through the Program (a) Amazon is only facilitating the liquidation of your Eligible Items and is neither the seller nor the buyer of record for these transactions and (b) Amazon doesn't guarantee that your Eligible Units will be purchased or, if they are purchased, the amount you will receive for your Eligible Items.
  5. **Liquidation fees.** You will pay the fees listed on the [Help Page](/gp/help/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF) for the liquidation services described in section 4.
  6. **Storage fees.** Monthly storage fees and long-term storage fees will cease to accrue for Eligible Items that you submit for liquidation on the date that you submit the liquidation request. If we are unable to find a buyer for these items within the Liquidation Facilitation Period, we will return them to your inventory and monthly and long-term storage fees will continue to accrue for these items until they are disposed of or you remove them from our fulfillment center.
