The Vine dashboard will give you access to all the products you have enrolled
under the Vine program. Your most recent enrollments are easily accessible on
the first page of this dashboard, while older enrollments can be accessed by
entering the ASIN or SKU in the search bar of the Vine dashboard. The Vine
dashboard is also where you can see if your enrollments encounter any
blockers. You can also see whether your Vine products have been ordered and
reviewed, or cancel your enrollments.

Enrollments can be classified as concluded, reviews in progress, awaiting
reviews, canceled by seller, or action required.

  * **Concluded** : Enrollments will conclude when any of these conditions is met, whichever happens first:
    * Enrollments conclude after 90 days from enrollment or scheduled start date, if set. Vine voices don’t have any timeline to post a review and its possible to still to get a review after the enrollment has been concluded.
    * After the first 30 days, they will conclude once all units are reviewed.
    * Enrollments will not conclude within the first 30 days of enrollment.
    * If all units have received a review, this enrollment will not receive any more vine reviews.
  * **Reviews in progress** means some of the expected reviews have been posted.
  * **Awaiting reviews** : Refers to enrollments that are yet to receive any review.
  * **Canceled by seller** : Refers to enrollments you have canceled.
  * **Action required** : Refers to blocked enrollments. You will either need to correct the offer or SKU you enrolled in Vine, update some of your product’s catalog attributes, or send more inventory to resolve the block. For some listing errors, such as if the enrolled product’s set parent or child relationship does not exist anymore, you would need to cancel and re-enroll your product. For more information on the action required status, go to [Vine errors](/gp/help/GFW53X4JYHRCU9YH).

#### In the Vine dashboard:

You will be able to see the date you enrolled the product in Vine and the
number of units that are still available for Vine Voices to request. You will
also be able to see the number of units you enrolled, the number of units Vine
Voices claimed, and the number of Vine reviews that were published.

#### After clicking Details:

You will be able to edit specific aspects of your enrollment, such as cancel
the enrollment. To access the Vine reviews, you can go to the product detail
page on the Amazon website.

#### Timeline for enrollments:

  * If your ASIN is eligible for the program, enrolling an item in Vine is immediate.
  * In most cases, Vine Voices can start ordering units within 24 hours of the enrollment being completed.
  * Vine Voices can start leaving reviews immediately after receiving units.
  * Approximately 25% of reviews received occur within five days of the order, while 99% of reviews received occur within 35 days of the order (based on Vine's worldwide reviewer population as of April 2018).
  * Vine Voices are not required to leave a review on the product, but we update our pool of reviewers often in order to ensure only the most active, helpful reviewers are part of Vine.
  * All Voices are guided to use the “Contact Us” from within the Vine website which gets directly routed to Vine Customer Support Team.
  * If an item received by the reviewer is defective, damaged, or the reviewer receives an incorrect product due to labeling issues, we will cancel the Vine Voices order if they contact us, and they will not leave a review.
