To learn about the benefits of enrolling a brand in Amazon Brand Registry,
watch this Seller University video:

Amazon Brand Registry is a global service that helps you protect your brand’s
intellectual property (IP). When you enroll in Brand Registry, you unlock
eligibility for a suite of tools that allows you to more easily manage your
brand’s product listings, find and report IP violations, and prevent non-
authentication.

To be eligible for Brand Registry, your brand must have one of the following:

  * An active registered trademark in each country where you would like to enroll
  * A pending trademark application that is filed through Amazon IP Accelerator
  * A trademark that is pending registration in a [subset of accepted trademark offices](/help/hub/reference/GHUDSVJLN4U9WY8Z)

The trademark must either be a text-based mark (word mark) or an image-based
mark (design mark). Additionally, the trademark text must match the brand name
that you provide in your Brand Registry application. If your trademark is an
image-based mark with words, letters, or numbers, you must upload a copy of
the image exactly as it appears in your trademark record.

**Note:** Design-only marks and logos aren’t accepted for initial enrollment
in Brand Registry. However, once your brand is enrolled, you can request to
add design-only marks and logos to your brand.

To learn more, go to [Enrollment guidelines for all accepted trademark
offices](/help/hub/reference/GHUDSVJLN4U9WY8Z).

## Enroll your brand

To enroll one or more brands in Brand Registry, click **Manage** and select
**Enroll a brand**.

During the enrollment process, you’ll be prompted to enter the following
information:

  * Your brand name that has an active registered trademark. We also accept brand names with a trademark that is pending registration in a subset of trademark offices. 
  * The government-registered trademark number. If you are enrolling with a trademark that is pending registration, you may provide the application number issued by the IP office. 
  * A list of product categories in which your brand must be listed, for example apparel, sporting goods, or electronics.

**Note:** The brand name of your trademark must be clearly visible and
permanently affixed to your products or packaging.

After you submit your application, we'll verify that you're the trademark
owner and we may contact the trademark correspondent or attorney listed in the
trademark record. This individual will receive a code, which you must send to
us so that we can verify your identity and complete the enrollment process.

Once you’ve completed the enrollment process and we've verified your identity,
you’ll become eligible to access Brand Registry benefits and features.
