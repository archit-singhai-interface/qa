Your [Payments dashboard](/gp/payments-account/settlement-summary.html) shows
you when and how much you will be paid. This information is automatically
updated and available in the Payment report.

This tool also displays your current payment information:

The Payments report will sometimes display an **Account level reserve**. This
is normal when selling on Amazon. An account level reserve usually indicates
the amount of funds that is reserved to ensure that you have enough funds to
fulfill any claims or
[chargebacks](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G48781).

## How can I get paid faster?

Keeping your seller account up to date and in good standing is the best way to
prevent potential payment delays.

  * Update your [bank account](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/sw/AccountInfo/DepositMethodView/step/DepositMethodView?ref_=macs_aidepvw_cont_acinfohm&) or [credit card information](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/sw/AccountInfo/ChargeMethod/step/View?ref_=macs_aichrgvw_cont_acinfohm) in Account Settings.
  * Resolve [claims](/gp/guarantee-claims/home.html) or [chargebacks](/gp/chargebacks/home.html) quickly.
  * Be quick to ship your items, and confirm shipments in [Manage orders](/gp/orders-v2/list/).
  * [Provide valid tracking numbers](/gp/help/201817070) when you confirm shipment. This gives buyers peace of mind in knowing that their package is on its way.
  * Maintain high performance standards. For more information, go to [Account Health Rating program policy](/help/hub/reference/G200205250).
  * [See if you are eligible](/sw/AccountInfo/DepositMethodView/step/DepositMethodView?ref_=macs_aidepvw_cont_acinfohm&) for [Express payout](/gp/help/GA24UN79VBPKXZXX) to receive transfers within twenty-four hours.

**Note:** You cannot edit a scheduled payment.

## I'm still not seeing my money. What should I do?

It can take up to five business days for your money to appear in your bank
account after we initiate payment.

For more information about when we disburse payments, see [Payments based on
delivery date](/gp/help/G202124090).

If it has been longer than five business days, you can track the payment with
the Bank Transfer ID found at the top of your [Payments report](/gp/payments-
account/settlement-summary.html). Your bank can use this ID to research where
your money might be.

If you expected a payment but did not receive one, go to [Account
health](/performance/dashboard) in Seller Central to learn more about your
account performance and payment policy.

You might have unavailable balance. For more information, go to [What is
account level reserve?](/gp/help/200136810)
