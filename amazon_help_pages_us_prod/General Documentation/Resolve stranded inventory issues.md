Amazon provides a **Stranded reason** column on [Fix stranded
inventory](/inventoryplanning/stranded-inventory). This column shows why each
listing is stranded. The **Additional information** column displays more
information and instructions.

See the table below for a list of every **Stranded reason** and **Additional
information** , including recommended actions.

##  Key features on the new Fix stranded inventory page

#### More accurate and up-to-date

Sometimes, a listing shows as **Active** in **Manage inventory** while it
shows as **Stranded** on [Fix stranded inventory](/inventoryplanning/stranded-
inventory). Note that **Fix stranded inventory** has the most accurate and up-
to-date information.

#### "Stranded reason" column

This column gives you information about the stranded inventory. You can also
see more details and what action to take.

#### Filtering by "Stranded reason" and "Recommendations"

These features allow you to sort and better understand why listings are
stranded and what to do to resolve each issue.

#### "Date of stranded event column

This column shows how long your inventory has been stranded while accumulating
storage fees. You can also use the date shown in this column to help locate
email and performance notifications related to the listing.

#### 1-click actions

**1-click relist** allows you to relist with a single click without leaving
the page. If you have to make edits to the listing before activating the
listing, click **Edit listing** or **Relist**.

**1-click change to FBA** allows you to change fulfillment channels with a
single click without leaving the page. This option is only available for
listings where dangerous goods information is provided. A dangerous goods
submission is required for all listings. If you have not previously provided
this information or if you have to change previously provided information,
click **Change to FBA** to change fulfillment channels.

#### Bulk and automatic actions

**Bulk relist** allows you to select up to 25 items to relist at once. After
choosing these items, you can relist all listings at once with **1-click
relist** as the recommended action.

**Note:** When relisting in bulk, you cannot make catalog or listing changes
for any of the affected listings. To edit the listing before activating it,
click **Edit** or **Relist**.

**Bulk 1-click change to FBA** allows you to select 25 items at once to change
fulfillment channels. After choosing these items, you can relist all listings
at once with **1-click change to FBA** as the recommended action.

**Note:** When using **1-click change to FBA** in bulk, you cannot provide or
update dangerous goods information. To provide dangerous goods information,
use **Change to FBA**.

**Automatic relist** automatically relists inventory that has been stranded
for seven days under these stranded reasons:

  * Listing closed
  * Item discontinued

You can adjust this setting by clicking **Edit automatic-action settings**.
For listings that you don't want automatically relisted, select **Opt out of
auto action** in the drop-down arrows to the right of the listing.

**Automatic change to FBA** automatically changes the fulfillment channel to
FBA for inventory that has been stranded for five days under the stranded
reason **Merchant fulfilled**. You can adjust this setting by clicking **Edit
automatic-action settings**. For listings that you don't want changed to FBA,
select **Opt out of auto action** in the drop-down arrows to the right of the
listing.

**Auto-relist** can be set to relist in as little as two days. **Auto-change
to FBA** can change fulfillment channels in less than one day if you set it to
0 days.

**Important:** If you manage expiration dates by stranding inventory, you can
avoid automatic reactivation by setting the **Start selling date/Offer start
date** to strand the inventory until a future time. Automatic actions will not
apply to these listings.

Here are some tips for using automatic actions:

  * You can prevent accidentally stranding inventory via bulk upload templates or APIs. Set the **Auto-change in FBA** settings to 0 or 1 day to make sure that your inventory is quickly unstranded and available for sale.
  * Temporarily close listings for vacation, product evaluation, or religious observance. Close your listings in **Manage inventory** and set auto-relist to have them automatically relisted after the desired number of days.
  * Prevent lost sales when you have to close a listing for a restricted ASIN that will be reinstated. After the listing is reinstated, it stays stranded as a closed listing. Change your **Auto-relist** settings to activate the listing more quickly.

## How to resolve stranded inventory

All sellers are expected to update their stranded auto-removal settings to
remove stranded inventory automatically. Note that if you have an account in
multiple stores, you must configure your auto-removal settings in each store.
If you have designated Amazon to accelerate the removal of stranded inventory,
the units will be removed more quickly.
