These terms supplement your seller agreement and apply to your use of
features, services, and functionality that Amazon makes available to enable
the listing, sale, and fulfillment of products in the Amazon Business Seller
Program.

## Program Feature Availability

Without notice and in its sole discretion, Amazon may modify, discontinue, or
cancel your participation in any aspect of the Amazon Business Seller Program.

## Business-Only Selection

Without limiting your obligations under your seller agreement, if you offer
Business-Only Selection, you agree to (1) maintain industry standard and any
other certifications and licenses required by applicable laws or regulations
for each product or service that you offer through any Amazon Site and (2)
upon Amazon's request, provide copies of these certifications and licenses to
us. You also agree not to sell products or services to customers who lack any
required certifications, prescriptions, or licenses. For more information
about Business-Only Selection, [click here](/gp/help/G201958670).

## Negotiating Pricing

If you provide to Amazon in the manner we specify (1) a list of products; (2)
the corresponding prices you have negotiated for a specific, registered Amazon
Business customer; and (3) the expiration date of these negotiated prices,
Amazon will make the negotiated prices available to that customer on the
Amazon Site. If Amazon ever fails to make your negotiated prices available,
your sole and exclusive remedy will be for Amazon to return to the customer on
your behalf any excess amount paid. Your Materials as defined by your seller
agreement includes any negotiated pricing information that you make available
to us.

Customers will be given the chance to approve negotiated prices you provide to
us. Customer-approved prices will be applicable from the time of approval
until the expiration date agreed, unless the customer approves any subsequent
changes.

## Fees

Business Seller Program, see the [Selling on Amazon Business Fee
