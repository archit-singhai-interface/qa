Selling on Amazon is simple. If you have a product to sell which already
exists on Amazon, you can match to the existing listing. If you are unable to
locate your product on Amazon, you can **Create a new listing**.

Use the following tools on Seller Central to match and create your listings:

  * [Add a Product](/hz/productsearch): We recommend using this tool, if you want to sell a small number of products. It is a web-based interactive listing tool that guides you through the process of adding one product listing at a time. To learn how to use this tool effectively, see [Add One Product at a Time](/gp/help/G200220550). To learn more, visit [Using Add-a-Product (New Experience)](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/learn/courses?ref_=su_courses_c4_m74bb15b6-7d45-46f6-9998-c9d995852877&moduleId=74bb15b6-7d45-46f6-9998-c9d995852877&modLanguage=English).
  * [Add Products via Upload](/listing/download?ref_=xx_download_tnav_status): If you have a large number of products to sell, we recommend using the 'Add Product via Upload' tool. This tool gives you access to excel spreadsheets called 'Inventory file templates', where you can enter information for product listings in bulk and upload them onto your seller account. For more information, see [Create your inventory file template](/gp/help/202094740). Watch the video demonstration on Bulk Inventory Uploads for New Sellers.

**Note:**

  * Before you begin selling, identify the Selling Plan your account has been registered with. Go to your [Seller Account Information](/hz/sc/account-information/ref=xx_acctinfo_dnav_xx) to know more. See [Selling plan comparison](/gp/help/64491) to learn more about the differences between Professional and Individual selling plans.
  * If you have an Individual Selling plan, you cannot access or use the Add Products via Upload tool.
