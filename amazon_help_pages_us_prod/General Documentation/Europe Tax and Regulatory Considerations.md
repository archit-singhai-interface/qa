your professional advisers if you have any questions.

Selling in Europe provides opportunities to reach many countries from a single
selling account, so it's important that you understand how the European Union
applies Value Added Tax (VAT) to orders made online.

## The VAT

The VAT in the European Union is a consumption tax assessed on the value added
to goods and services. It applies to goods and service that are bought and
sold for use or consumption in the European Community. Thus, goods that are
sold for export or services that are sold to customers abroad are normally not
subject to VAT. Imports into the European Union (EU) are taxed.

Value Added Tax is:

  * A general tax that applies to all commercial activities involving the production and distribution of goods.
  * A consumption tax.
  * Charged as a percentage of price, which means that the actual tax burden is visible at each stage in the production and distribution chain.
  * Collected fractionally, through a system of partial payments whereby taxable persons (that is, VAT-registered businesses) deduct the amount of tax they have paid from the VAT they have collected on purchases for their business activities. This mechanism ensures that the tax is neutral regardless of how many transactions are involved.
  * Paid to the revenue authorities by the seller of the goods-that is the "taxable person"-but it is actually paid by the buyer to the seller as part of the price. It is thus an indirect tax.

(VAT)](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/what-is-vat_en)

##  How is VAT charged?

Registered VAT traders are given a VAT number and have to show the VAT
collected from customers on invoices. In this way, the customer, if he is a
registered trader, knows how much he can deduct in turn, and the consumer
knows how much tax he has paid on the final product.

##  VAT coverage and VAT rates

Given that EU law only requires that the standard VAT rate must be at least
15% and the reduced rate at least 5%, actual rates applied vary between Member
States and between certain types of products. In addition, certain member
states have retained separate rules in specific areas.

The most reliable source of information on current VAT rates for a specified
product in a particular member state is that country's VAT authority.

##  VAT on imports and exports

When selling products into the EU or from one EU member state to another, you
should be aware that the tax rate can be different from country to country. If
you transfer your own goods from one EU country to another, or if FBA
transfers your goods from a fulfillment center into another country where your
products were stored, the transfer may also be treated as a transaction
subject to VAT. You are responsible for meeting any VAT obligations that
apply, including VAT obligations in the Amazon marketplace website locations,
the country to which you are delivering or shipping your products, or any
other countries.

**Tip:** When selling in multiple Amazon European marketplaces, keep in mind
that you may be liable to pay VAT to different member states and so may need
to apply for different VAT numbers with different member states. Consult your
tax advisor to help you understand your VAT obligations in the EU.

If you import products into the European Union, you may be obliged to pay VAT
the moment the goods enter Europe-and in the destination country where you
ship the goods. VAT is usually payable in the member state of import by the
declarant. You will be liable for the import VAT at the time of delivery of
the goods unless you have entered into an arrangement with your supplier for
the import VAT to be included in the price of the goods, and for the supplier
to discharge the obligation by making a payment to the relevant tax authority.

If you are a company not established in the EU and ship your products from a
non-EU country directly to a customer in an EU country, or you ship your
products into an EU fulfillment center, please consult your tax advisor to
assess any import and VAT obligations you may have.

Goods sold for export to customers outside of the EU will not be subject to EU
VAT but local VAT rules may apply.

Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/what-is-vat_en)
website.

##  Registering for a VAT number and filing VAT returns

When you sell your products in the EU, you may need to charge VAT. You may
need to request a VAT registration number, file VAT returns, and pay the VAT
you collected from your customers to the tax authorities.

In most EU countries, you can register online on the tax authority's website
for the country where you want to register. Most of these websites provide the
VAT information in English. The website will usually provide an online form
for registering or a PDF form you can download to complete and return by mail.
If there is no provision for registering online, you can find out where to go
to register for a VAT number. After you have submitted your request for a VAT
number, you may also be sent forms to sign and return through regular mail.

Registering for VAT may lead to a number of associated compliance
requirements, including the need to file reports and issue VAT invoices.

**Important:** For additional information, see our [How to handle
VAT](https://sell.amazon.com/global-selling/case-studies/eu-vat.html) page.

##  Registering for VAT in multiple countries

Registering for VAT may be required depending on the level of your sales as
well as where your inventory is stored. You should consult your tax advisors
as to your VAT registration requirements based on your individual seller set
up.

When you sell products to customers from your inventory stored in the EU, you
may need to file VAT returns in the country from which you ship your products,
and you may be required to file VAT returns in the country to which you ship
your products (when exceeding the threshold for so-called "distance selling").

##  Distance selling of goods

Distance selling is when you sell goods from one EU country to customers in
another EU country where, generally speaking, these customers are private
individuals without undertaking any business activity for VAT purposes.

The "distance selling threshold" is a value in Euros established by each
country in the EU. If your sales that you ship from one country into another
country are greater than that country's threshold, you must register for VAT
in that country. You are responsible to report, collect, and pay the VAT in
that country.

Please note that the distance selling threshold is not a sum total of all your
sales across the EU. Each EU country has a distance selling threshold, and
these thresholds vary from country to country. Consult with a tax authority
for the country where you want to sell your products to verify the distance
selling threshold.

##  VAT invoicing

In many EU countries, customers expect a VAT invoice. VAT laws in the country
where the customer is located may require you to provide a VAT invoice, and
customers' expectations usually go beyond the law. In Germany and Italy, for
example, customers often expect an invoice for high-value items.

##  European regulatory considerations

## Customs

When you import goods into the European Union (EU), you will need to comply
with EU customs laws, as well as laws and regulations that are applicable to
the EU country of import. Please note that you are not authorized to import
your goods in the name of Amazon EU S.à r.l. or any other Amazon subsidiary or
affiliate (indistinctly referred to as "Amazon" and its corporate name as an
"Amazon name") or to reference Amazon anywhere in your shipping documentation.
Otherwise, your shipments may be returned to their origin, abandoned, or
disposed of at your cost, at the discretion of the carrier or freight
forwarder carrying your goods.

Importation regulations may differ between countries in the EU and will depend
on the mode of shipping you choose. Therefore, you should strongly consider
hiring a logistics provider, such as a customs broker or freight forwarder, to
handle the importation process for your company and help you understand all
applicable requirements.

## Commercial invoice

When your goods are ready to be shipped from your facility, manufacturer, or
distributor, the shipper prepares the commercial invoice. It is critical that
the commercial invoice be accurate to avoid delays in clearing customs. The
following information must be included on the commercial invoice when
importing goods into an EU country:

  * Invoice issue date.
  * The complete name and address of the exporter or shipper (seller or manufacturer).
  * The shipper's contact name, company name, address, and tax ID number.
  * Ship-to address. Provide the legal name of your company, followed by "c/o FBA." Below this, you may use the address of the Amazon fulfillment center to which your goods should be delivered. Amazon does not, however, authorize you to include any Amazon name in this address. Please see the example below.
  * Importer of record: Provide the legal name of your company or EU import representative, along with full contact details, Economic Operators' Registration and Identification number (EORI) and VAT registration number for the country of import (example below). Prior to shipping, you should consider ensuring that your company or representative can fulfill all criteria to act as importer of record in the country of import. Leaving this information blank also can result in your shipment being refused and returned.

**Important:** Amazon expressly prohibits the use of an Amazon name, including
a fulfillment center's name, as the importer of record for any shipment of FBA
inventory. **Any FBA inventory shipment attempting to make entry with an
Amazon name as the importer of record will be refused and returned at the
shipper's expense —no exceptions.** Leaving this information blank also can
result in your shipment being refused and returned.

Example "Ship to/Deliver to" field | Example "Importer of record" field  
---|---  
[Seller legal name] c/o FBA1401 Rue du Champ Rouge 45770 Saran, France | [Seller legal name] or [Seller's representative legal name]1234 Rue de Lyon 9876 Paris, France EORI: XY123456789 VAT ID: YX87654321  
  
Please note the differences in addresses. The "Ship-to" address includes the
Amazon fulfillment center, while the "Importer of record" address includes the
seller's or seller representative's registered address.

  * FBA Shipment ID (FBA reference). This is the number you receive when you create the shipment in your Amazon seller account. This ensures that Amazon can quickly identify the shipment as belonging to FBA if customs questions arise. If your FBA Shipment ID in Seller Central does not contain "FBA," please add it in a visible place on the invoice.
  * Detailed description of the goods invoiced. Includes, among other required elements, the following: 
    * Harmonized Tariff Schedule Code (HTS Code)
    * Product quantity
    * Value of each product. For samples or products with no commercial value, a nominal or fair-market value must be stated for customs purposes
    * Total value of all products in a shipment
  * Currency of the transaction

Additional information may also be required. These requirements are subject to
change. It is your responsibility to determine and comply with import
requirements.

Depending on the type of product, there may be additional certificates and
licenses required for import. These can include a Declaration of Conformity,
test reports or leather certificates.

Please check with your logistics provider or customs broker to ensure that you
have the complete documentation needed to import into the EU destination
country.

##  Delivery best practices

Amazon fulfillment centers have requirements for the shipments they receive,
including the size of the pallets and the type of truck that can deliver to
the fulfillment center. Paying attention to these requirements and best
practices will help avoid delays in getting your inventory to the fulfillment
center and into your customers' hands.

##  Using standard postal services

Using postal services such as China Post, Royal Mail, Parcelforce, and
Deutsche Post to send your shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers is not
recommended. Postal services may have different importer of record
requirements for their shipments than for freight or express carrier
shipments. It is possible that by using postal services to ship your goods,
you could not ship to an Amazon fulfillment center as the IOR. If you are
considering a postal service as a shipping option, you should consider sending
the shipment to the address of your representative in the country of import
and, after the shipment is delivered, forward the goods to the Amazon
fulfillment center address. Prior to shipping, you may want to check with the
postal service that your company or representative can be the importer of
record.

## Intellectual property rights

You should ensure that you have all intellectual property rights (such as
patents, trademarks, or copyrights) necessary for listing your products in the
EU or selling them cross-border within the EU. You may need to have the
permission of the brand owner to sell their products in a given EU member
state in order to avoid an infringement of intellectual property rights (as in
the case where your license to the intellectual property is only valid for a
specific country). In particular, your products must not be counterfeit or
illegal parallel imports.

You should investigate the law governing intellectual property for every
country where you want to list your products because your rights in
intellectual property may only be valid for a particular country.

In addition, you may want to protect your own intellectual property in the EU.

## Parallel import

An intellectual property rights owner (in particular trademark owners,
copyright holders and their licensees) may prohibit you from importing or
selling his goods in the European Economic Area (EEA), if you sourced them
outside the EEA.

This prohibition applies even if the rights owner distributes the same product
type in the EEA or does not distribute in the EEA, as long as he holds an
intellectual property right in the EEA. Therefore, if you intend to list e.g.
branded products or media items on Amazon’s EU marketplaces which you source
outside that region, seek expert legal advice and make sure the rights owner
does not object to such parallel import. Otherwise, Amazon may be asked by the
rights owner to take down your listings on Amazon’s EU marketplaces for IP
infringement. Repeated cases of IP infringements will also affect your ability
to continue selling on Amazon.

Parallel import of goods sourced outside the EEA for sale in the EEA with the
rights owner’s consent could still affect customer experience if the non-EEA
product differs from the EEA version in any way (e.g., packaging, warranty
coverage, product variations). Describe your product appropriately to avoid
negative customer feedback.

For more information, see: [Important Information for International
Sellers](/gp/help/200404870).

## Markings and labels

The "CE" mark is a mandatory conformance mark on many products (such as low-
voltage equipment, medical devices, toys, personal protective equipment, and
so on). By attaching the "CE" marking, the manufacturer declares that the
product is in conformity with the requirements of the applicable European
directives.

There are many other marks and labels in the EU (for example, textiles,
products in contact with food, recycling, and so on), which you may be
required to display on your products or packaging. Often product labeling is
required to be in the language of the European member state where the product
is sold.

## Environment, health and safety

## Chemicals - REACH/CLP

REACH is the European regulation on chemicals and their safe use. It deals
with the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical
substances. Under the REACH regulation, one of the things manufacturers and
importers may be required to do is to gather certain information on the
properties of the chemical substances in their products, and to register the
information in a central database run by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).

In addition to REACH, the Regulation for Classification, Labeling, and
Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP Regulation) may apply to your
products. The CLP Regulation incorporates the classification criteria and
labeling rules agreed at the United Nations level, the so-called Globally
Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). GHS is
based on the principle that the same hazards should be described and labeled
in the same way all around the world.

## Electrical and electronical equipment - WEEE/RoHS

If you are selling electrical or electronic equipment, you may be subject to
the EU legislation concerning Restrictions of the Use of Hazardous Substances
(RoHS) and/or the collection and recycling of Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE).

Some requirements of the WEEE regulations that you may be subject to:

  * Display the "crossed-out wheeled bin" symbol on your products. The symbol indicates that the product should not be disposed of as normal waste, but rather in specific recycling centers.
  * Join an authorized WEEE collection and recycling scheme in any EU member state in which you sell applicable products.

If you sell batteries or products that contain batteries, you may be subject
to the Battery Directive. The Battery Directive imposes specific obligations
on producers and distributors of batteries.

Some requirements you may be subject:

  * Display the "crossed-out wheeled bin" symbol on your batteries. The symbol indicates that the battery should not be disposed of as normal waste, but rather in specific recycling centers.
  * Join an authorized battery collection and recycling scheme in any European member state in which you sell your batteries.

## Product compliance

## Plugs and voltage

Countries in Europe use different types of plugs-for instance, the U.K. 3-pin
rectangular plug and the continental European 2-pin round plug. In addition,
products you import into the EU might work on a different voltage.

Please ensure that you comply with the regulations on plugs and voltage in any
EU member state in which you list your products. In particular, your customers
should be able to safely use your products. .

##  Medical devices

Medical devices range from simple products like bandages to the most
sophisticated life-supporting products. If your product is considered a
medical device, you may be subject to the European Medical Devices Directive.
The Directive requires, among other things, that medical devices shall not
compromise the safety and health of patients, or users and other persons when
properly implanted, maintained, and used.

## Pharmaceuticals and cosmetics

Pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are subject to various regulations in Europe,
including special labeling and packaging requirements. The regulations are
only partially harmonized. For example, a product may be sold over-the-counter
in some European member states, while in others it may only be legally sold in
pharmacies.

Food and food products are subject to many regulations in Europe. European
food regulations in particular aim at establishing high-quality standards for
food and food product hygiene, animal health and welfare, and plant health,
and prevent the risk of contamination from external substances.

European food regulations include, among many other things, the following:

  * Specifying rules on appropriate labeling for food products. Often product labeling is required to be in the language of the European member state where the product is sold.
  * Establishing mandatory refund and recycling schemes for beverage packaging in several European member states.

## Consumer rights

Please note that these consumer rights are described for illustrative purposes
only and do not constitute any legal advice or substitute for any contractual
obligation that you may have agreed upon with Amazon or directly with the
consumer.

## Rights of cancellation

With some exceptions, consumers in the European Union have the right to cancel
a purchase of a product bought online within 14 days of receiving the final
item of the order, if they purchased multiple items together that were
delivered separately. Even when there is no error from your side, you must
refund the item and the shipping costs. You may not have to refund all costs
unless one of the following is true:

  

  1. There is an error on your side.
  2. You agreed to bear all costs for the consumer.
  3. You failed to disclose or inform the customer about the costs that you are legally required to disclose.

For example, you must refund the normal cost of sending the item to the
consumer but not any extra costs for services that the customer chooses, such
as expedited delivery or gift-wrapping. Similarly, when you expressly inform
the consumer, you don't have to bear the cost of returning the product to you.

Please note that these consumer rights are in addition to any contractual
return rights that you may have agreed upon with Amazon (e.g. 30-day return
guarantee) or directly with the consumer.

## Legal warranty

Under EU consumer protection rules, the seller of a product must offer a
2-year Legal Warranty when selling in the EU. This means that, during the
period of 2 years from the delivery of the product, you must repair, exchange
or reimburse a defective product. In most EU countries, any defect that
becomes apparent within 6 months from delivery is presumed to have existed at
the time of delivery and therefore you must repair, exchange or reimburse it.
After 6 months, in most EU countries (France excluded), you can request the
customer to prove that the defect already existed at the time of delivery. You
can find more information regarding the Legal Warranty in the following
[link](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-
returns/index_en.htm) from the European Commission.

This Legal Warranty obligation is in addition to your obligation to process
customer returns according to [Amazon Return
Policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=15015721).
