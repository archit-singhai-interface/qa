While leaving feedback on an order, buyers can select a star rating and from a
set of pre-defined reasons. Buyers can also leave their comments as free-form
text. Feedback consists of the feedback rating and the feedback comment, which
describes buyersâ€™ order fulfillment experience in their own words. To leave
feedback, a buyer must rate you using a 5-star system:

  * Positive feedback: 5 or 4 stars 
  * Neutral feedback: 3 stars
  * Negative feedback: 2 or 1 stars 

Good feedback often starts with a good buyer experience and positive buyer
feedback improves your Feedback Rating. If you receive negative feedback, you
should try to find the cause of the problem and work toward a resolution.

Visit [Feedback Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/seller-

to see your most current feedback and rating. You can learn more about

## About feedback ratings

Feedback percentages are rounded off to the nearest whole number and
therefore, your totals can sometimes add up to 99% instead of 100%. For
example, if a seller has 1,001 positive, 15 neutral, and 4 negative ratings
out of a total of 1,020 ratings, the percentages will show as 98% (rounded off
from .981), 1% (rounded off from .014), and 0% (rounded off from .003), for a
total of 99%.

We calculate your feedback score using the following method:

SUM (positive feedback) / SUM (all feedback) for feedback left in the last 30
days, 90 days, 365 days, and lifetime

For example, suppose you get the following feedback scores:

Feedback | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Ratings per feedback | 55 | 35 | 5 | 3 | 2  
  

  1. Total of all positive feedback=90
  2. Total of all feedback (1 through 5)=100
  3. Divide positive feedback by all feedback
  4. Feedback score=90.0% 

**Note:** We aggregate your feedback into 30 days, 90 days, 365 days, and
lifetime time-range buckets. Your aggregated star rating and positive feedback
percentage will change with time accordingly as your feedback accumulates in
different time-range buckets.

## About display of feedback ratings

If you have more than 10 buyer feedbacks over the previous 12 months, buyers
will see your 12 month feedback rating and lifetime feedback total ratings in
the following format on the **All-Offers Display** page:

**XX% positive over the past 12 months. (YYYY total ratings).**

If you have less than 10 buyer feedbacks in the previous 12 months, or all of
your feedbacks are in the past year, buyers will see your lifetime feedback
rating and lifetime feedback total ratings in the following format on the
**All-Offers Display** page:

**XX% positive. (YYYY total ratings).**

Refer to the following sources for facilitating positive buyer feedbacks.
