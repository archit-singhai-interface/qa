To list products on Amazon, you have to create offers. There are several ways
to create an offer.

If the product you want to sell is already in Amazon’s catalog, create a new
product listing by matching it to the existing product detail page. If you
want to create multiple product listings at once, you can do so by using
inventory file templates.

If the product you want to sell is not in Amazon’s catalog, create a new
product listing and a new product detail page. In order to successfully list
your products, you must upload at least one image that meets the image
requirements.

In this set of pages, you can find information necessary to create and manage
offers. Select a page from left navigation pane to see more information.
