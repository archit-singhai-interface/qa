Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions so that you can easily find
the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, go to [Trade Marks Registry
(TMR)](https://tmrsearch.ipindia.gov.in/eregister/) and search for your
trademark by following these steps:

  

  1. Click **Trade mark application/registered mark**. 
  2. Under **Select the search option** , select either **National/IRDI number** or **International registration number** based on the number that you have on file.
  3. In the **Enter trade mark/application number** field, enter the application number (trademark number). 
  4. Enter the CAPTCHA, and click **View**. 
  5. In the search results table, find your trademark and click the hyperlink of the number in the **Trade mark no.** column. 
  6. Next to **TM applied for** , confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name.

## Brand name

On the Brand Registry application, under **What is your brand name?** , enter
the trademark name exactly as it appears on TMR.

**Note:** If your trademark is a design mark, TMR may add additional words to
the trademark name (for example, “& Design,” “Et Dessin,” “Device of,” “&
Dessin,” “Design,” “Logo,” or “Label”). Do not include these words when
entering your brand name in the application.

## Trademark office

Under **Select the trademark office associated with your brand** on the Brand
Registry application, select **India – Trademark Registry – TMR**.

## Registration number

To find your trademark’s registration number on TMR, review the information
next to **TM Application No**.

On the Brand Registry application, enter this number under **Enter the
trademark registration number**.

**_WIPO number_**

If you’re applying with a trademark that was issued by the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) with designation in India, enter the **TM
Application No.** on **TMR**. Do not enter your WIPO number on your Brand
Registry application.

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from India that are either registered or pending
registration.

To find the status of your trademark on TMR, review the details next to
**Status**.

Then, locate your trademark's status in the table below to understand if it is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. Enter the
corresponding status under **Select the current status of your trademark** on
the Brand Registry application.

Status on TMR | Status to select on Brand Registry application

**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

To find your trademark’s type on TMR, review the information next to **Trade
mark type**.

If you see "Word," your trademark is a text-based mark (word mark). If you see
"Device,” "Logo," “Label,” "Colour," or "Fancy," your trademark is an image-
based mark (design mark).

On the Brand Registry application, select the trademark type under **Select
the trademark type**.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark trademarks are eligible for initial
enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to your
account once you’re enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your brand](/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
