**Definition** | The shipping weight is calculated based on the item’s unit weight or dimensional weight.  
---|---  
**Using this article** | The shipping weight of an item is used to calculate FBA fulfillment fees. After reading this article, you will be able to determine the shipping weight for an item. To accomplish this task, first know the unit weight, product volume and dimensions, the dimensional weight, and the product size tier of the item.

## Determine the shipping weight

  

  1. Determine the product volume and dimensions of the item. 
  2. Determine the product size tier of the item. 
  3. Determine the unit weight of the item.
  4. Determine the dimensional weight and whether it is used to calculate the fees for the item.

Shipping weight is determined by the unit weight or dimensional weight,
depending on size tier and whichever is greater (see details below).

  * **Unit weight** is the measure of how much your product weighs packaged.
  * **Dimensional weight** is equal to the unit volume (length x width x height) divided by 139. The dimensional weight for large bulky and extra-large items assumes a minimum width and height of 2 inches. 

For core FBA excluding apparel, apparel, and dangerous goods products, we use
the greater of unit weight or dimensional weight to calculate the shipping
weight for all large standard-size, large bulky, and extra-large units,
excluding extra-large 150+ lb units. Small standard-size units and extra-large
150+ lb units use unit weight. This also applies to units fulfilled through
[Multi-Channel Fulfillment](/gp/help/G200332450) and units that are receiving
[Low-Price FBA rates](/help/hub/reference/GJTAVU7P2W2VE8Q9).

**Size tier** | **Shipping weight**  
Small standard size | Unit weight  
Large standard size | The greater of the unit weight or dimensional weight  
Large bulky  | The greater of the unit weight or dimensional weight  
Extra-large 0 to 50 lb, 50+ to 70 lb, and 70+ to 150 lb  | The greater of the unit weight or dimensional weight  
Extra-large 150+ lb | Unit weight

## Packaging and impact fees

Packaging can impact the dimensional and unit weight of the product. Fees are
calculated based on these weights, as explained above.

Here’s an example of how packaging can impact fees.

Original packaging | Packaging with reduced dimensions  
---|---  
Dimensions: 12.2 x 12.0 x 4.3 inches | Dimensions: 12.2 x 12.0 x 3.2 inches  
Unit weight: 3.6 lb | Unit weight: 3.6 lb  
Dimensional weight: 4.52 lb | Dimensional weight: 3.4 lb  
Shipping weight range: 4.5+ lb to 4.75 lb (based on dimensional weight, which is greater than unit weight) | Shipping weight range: 3.5+ lb to 3.75 lb (based on unit weight, which is greater than dimensional weight)  
Product size tier: Large standard-size (4.5+ lb to 4.75 lb)  | Product size tier: Large standard-size (3.5+ lb to 3.75 lb)   
Fee: $7.81 | Fee: $7.49, a fee reduction of $0.32 (4.1%)
