Verification Process, why?

You can check the following to complete the verification of your phone number:  

  1. Check whether the number you entered is in the correct format. To know the correct format, see the answer to this question **What is the correct format to verify the phone number?** below.
  2. If you have already verified your number, no further verification is required and no further verification request will be successful. You can proceed with the registration process.
  3. Try to verify your phone number using the SMS verification, which may include your country.
