[Your Information & Policies](/gp/help-content/home.html/ref=au_infopol) page
is a place where you can create information about your business to provide to
customers.

**Note:** If you don't see **Your Info & Policies** on the **Settings** menu,
you don't have access rights for this tool. Contact your account administrator
to gain access rights.

Using this tool, you can build help pages for customers that contain basic
information about your store, including the following:

#### About seller

Introduce your business and build your brand.

#### Seller Logo

You can upload an image of your business logo, which must be a .jpg, .jpeg or
a .gif file, 120 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall, and canâ€™t be animated. The
maximum file size of the image must be less or equal to 20,000 bytes. Websites
or email addresses should not be on the logo, as this would be considered to
be redirecting sales.

#### Shipping

Provide your shipping policies and rates.

#### Privacy Policy

This can be any extension to the existing Amazon website policy. This cannot
contradict Amazon's policies.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Provide answers about policies or products that are not answered on your other
Help pages.

#### Custom Help Pages

Here you can offer additional information for customers, such as sizing charts
and other product-specific and category-specific details.

#### Tax

Supply the details of your tax policies on purchased items.
