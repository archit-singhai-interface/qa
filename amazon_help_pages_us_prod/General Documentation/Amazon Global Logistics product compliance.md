Products shipped via Amazon Global Logistics must comply with customs
regulations and duty requirements. To ensure compliance, you will be asked to
provide or review a variety of product information when [booking
transportation](/gp/help/G5NQMLZ7E6UBPVNE) or later in the shipping process.

## Commodity descriptions

A commodity description is a brief account of a product being imported and is
required for each item that you ship. Customs clearance begins with commodity
descriptions on a [bill of lading (BOL)](/gp/help/GH34CM95UF7CCXKM).

Clear, accurate, and detailed commodity descriptions help reduce clearance and
delivery times and ensure that your shipment complies with regulations. Vague,
inaccurate, or incomplete descriptions can result in delivery delays, customs
duties being incorrectly calculated, your shipment being held or rejected by
customs, or all of the above. You may also be subject to financial penalties
or other actions by customs authorities if your commodity descriptions are
inaccurate.

Commodity descriptions must have precise information so that customs
authorities can identify and verify the **shape** , **physical
characteristics** , and **packaging** of each item. A good description answers
the following questions:

  * What is the item? 
  * What is it made from? 
  * What is its intended use? 

## Examples of good commodity descriptions

General descriptions like "electronics" are not detailed enough to meet
customs regulations. Descriptions like "CD players" or "computer monitors" are
acceptable. Make sure that your descriptions are in English.

Good description | Poor description  
---|---  
**organic caffeinated coffee** | general merchandise  
**men's wool socks** | samples  
**women's leather shoes** | promotional materials  
**computer keyboards and computer mouse** | parts  
**cell phone screen savers** | see commercial invoice  
**men’s 100% wool pants** | pants  
**women’s cotton jogger pants**  
**laptop computers** | electronics  
**cell phone charger and adapter**  
**CD players**  
  
## Manufacturer and supplier, and product origin

The **manufacturer** is the party that made or assembled your products.
Manufacturer information is required for all textile and apparel imports. If
your products are not textile or apparel products and you don’t know the
manufacturer, list one of the following as the **supplier** :

  * Yourself
  * The vendor you bought the products from
  * The exporter

The **product origin** is the country where a product was originally
manufactured. It is not necessarily the country from which you are shipping
the item. To help determine the country of origin for your product, see the US
Customs and Border Protection’s [rules of
origin](https://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/rules-origin).

## Tariff classification (HTS codes)

Most countries classify globally traded goods using tariff classification
codes. These codes determine the customs value of products and flag
requirements such as anti-dumping or countervailing duties (ADDs and CVDs)for
partner government agencies (PGAs).

Accurate Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes help reduce clearance and
shipping times, and ensure that your shipment complies with regulations.
Inaccurate codes can result in shipment delays, customs duties being
incorrectly calculated, your shipment being held or rejected by customs, or
all of the above. You may also be subject to financial penalties or other
actions by customs authorities if your HTS codes are inaccurate.

You can find appropriate tariff codes for your goods by using the US
International Trade Commission’s [HTS search](https://hts.usitc.gov/). Enter a
keyword such as “food,” “shoes,” or “plants,” then choose the appropriate
code.

## Additional compliance information that may be required

You may be asked to provide information related to the following:

  * Anti-dumping duties 
  * Countervailing duties 
  * Toxic Substance Control Act
  * Radiation-emitting devices
  * Lacey Act

## Anti-dumping duties (ADDs)

Certain products in your shipments may be subject to anti-dumping duties. If
so, you will be asked to apply them.

ADDs are imposed when the [US International Trade
Commission](https://www.usitc.gov/) and the[ US Department of
Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) determine that a manufacturer in another
country is importing goods into the US at a price that is lower than their
fair-market value. Though ADDs are applied to counter these lower prices and
protect US manufacturers, they do not prohibit the importation of goods.

For more information, see the [US Customs and Border Protection
website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/priority-issues/adcvd/), along with CBP
[definitions and
terminology](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Feb/ace-
terminology-10digit-company-status-20170125.pdf). Use the [CBP's search
tool](https://aceservices.cbp.dhs.gov/adcvdweb) to help determine if any of
your items require an ADD:  

  1. Enter a short description of your product (1 to 2 words) and click **Search**.
  2. Review each case for specific product information, including function and country of origin.
  3. If your product falls under the scope of a case, note the case number. You will enter it during shipment creation. 

## Countervailing duties (CVDs)

Certain items in your shipments may be subject to countervailing duties. If
so, you will be asked to apply them.

CVDs are charged when the [US International Trade
Commission](https://www.usitc.gov/) and the[ US Department of
Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) determine that a government in an
exporting country is providing subsidies and tax benefits to their
manufacturers that allow them to sell their products less expensively than US
manufacturers. Though CVDs are applied to counter these discounts and protect
US manufacturers, they do not prohibit the importation of goods.

For detailed information, see the [US Customs and Border Protection
website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/priority-issues/adcvd/), along with CBP
[definitions and
terminology](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Feb/ace-
terminology-10digit-company-status-20170125.pdf). Use the [CBP's
search](https://aceservices.cbp.dhs.gov/adcvdweb) to help determine if any of
your items require a CVD:  

  1. Enter a short description of your product (1 to 2 words) and click **Search**.
  2. Review each case for specific product information, including function and country of origin.
  3. If your product falls under the scope of a case, note the case number. You will enter it during shipment creation. 

## Toxic Substance Control Act

You may be asked to certify that all chemical substances in your shipment
either comply with or are not subject to the Toxic Substance Control Act
(TSCA). Visit the [US Environmental Protection Agency
website](https://www.epa.gov/tsca-import-export-requirements) to determine how
TSCA might apply to your items. To ensure that you can ship your items with
chemical substances via Amazon Global Logistics, visit our [restricted
products and dangerous goods](/gp/help/GARDA2ALG9F4BNR3) Help page.

## Radiation-emitting devices (RAD)

You may be asked to provide information about any radiation-emitting devices
in your shipment. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a RAD as
“any electrically powered product that can emit any form of radiation on the
electromagnetic spectrum.” For more information, see [Radiation-Emitting
Electronic Products](https://www.fda.gov/industry/regulated-
products/radiation-emitting-electronic-products).

## Lacey Act

If you’re importing wood or plant products into the US, the Lacey Act may
require you to declare the genus and species of those products. For more
information, visit the [US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
website](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/import-
information/SA_Lacey_Act) and [US National Plant Germplasm
System](https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxonomybrowse.aspx).

## Importer Security Filing (ISF)

The Importer Security Filing, commonly known as “10+2,” is a US Customs
regulation that requires importers and vessel-operating carriers to provide
advance shipment information to US Customs for US-bound ocean cargo.

As the importer, you are responsible for providing the authorized
representative (typically the customs broker) with a minimum set of data. If
your ocean shipment requires an ISF, you will be asked to review and confirm
ISF contact details for your booking. For information, visit [Booking
transportation with Amazon Global Logistics](/gp/help/G5NQMLZ7E6UBPVNE) and
the [US Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/border-
security/ports-entry/cargo-security/importer-security-filing-102).
