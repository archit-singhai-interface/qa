Many products intended to prevent, test for, or treat COVID-19 are expiration
dated. This help page is intended to help effectively track these products,
provide the best experience for our customers, and prevent suspension of your
offers due to customer complaints.

## Requirements

Expiration-dated COVID-19 products must follow these requirements:

  * Sellers listing COVID-19 products must adhere to all provisions of the expiration dates on FBA products policy, the expiration dates on seller-fulfilled products policy, or both as applicable.
  * According to Amazon’s expiration dates on FBA products policy and expiration dates on seller-fulfilled products policy, all medical devices must have expiration dates and must be labeled clearly in YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Best Practices

To meet customer expectations and adapt to the changing landscape of the
COVID-19 pandemic, you must consider these recommendations:

  * Label all items clearly, in accordance with the policies listed above, and in a consistent date format. Clearly note if a listed date is a manufacturing or production date, rather than an expiration date.
  * Expiration dates on inventory cannot be updated by Amazon’s fulfillment centers for any reason, including updates recommended by regulatory bodies. This includes, for example, US FDA updates to extend the product life of COVID-19 test kits.
  * For sellers using FBA who want to update expiration dates on COVID-19 home test kits, we recommend requesting the product be returned and conducting the update before reshipping the product to Amazon fulfillment centers.
