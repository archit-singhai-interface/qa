We want to ensure that products offered on Amazon are safe and there is no
risk that they will cause death, personal injury, or damage to property.
Listings of any products that are recalled by the manufacturer or a government
agency are prohibited. We also reserve the right to consider recalls made by
government agencies of other countries.

Customers trust that they can always buy with confidence on Amazon. Products
you offer for sale must comply with your seller agreement, including all
applicable Amazon policies and all applicable laws and regulations. This could
increase your chances of succeeding as a seller on Amazon, as well as help you
avoid practices that could lead to blocked listings, or even prevent you from
selling on Amazon.

## Products that require additional approvals

Our policies require that certain products sold on Amazon meet specified
certification standards. Ensure that you read all of the requirements and
guidance before applying to sell these products. To apply, follow the
instructions on the product page.
