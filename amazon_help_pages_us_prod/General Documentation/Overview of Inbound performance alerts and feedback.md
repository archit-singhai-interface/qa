Amazon notifies you about problems with your inventory shipments in the
following three ways:

  * [Inbound performance alerts](/gp/help/GG8BFCDWM4ZY4DU)
  * [Inbound performance feedback in Seller Central](/gp/help/KXFMU67GUD45GUZ)
  * [Inbound performance notifications](/gp/help/KHEKK2WJN9KABZQ)

Performance alerts and feedback provide visibility into issues with your
shipments. You can use the feedback to avoid problems in the future.

**Note:** In order to understand how to avoid your specific shipment issue,
refer to the corresponding Problem group tables in [ Inbound Performance
Summary](/gp/help/G200893760). You may be charged per-unit fees for services
to resolve shipment issues and to receive your products. For more information,
see [Unplanned services](/gp/help/G201000230).
