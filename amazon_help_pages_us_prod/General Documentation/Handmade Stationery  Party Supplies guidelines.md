As a Maker, your handmade Stationery and Party Supplies products must adhere
to the following guidelines:

  * All products must adhere to [Amazonâ€™s general policies and agreements](/gp/help/G521).
  * All products must adhere to the [Category, product, and listing restrictions](/gp/help/G200301050).
  * All products must meet the overall [Amazon Handmade: Category Listing Policies & Requirements](/gp/help/GNGMMFQ5FPLJFBJP).
  * We realize some products, like stationery, invitations, cards must be sent to an outside printing company due to the cost of the machinery. We will consider this option as long as you are creating the designs and completing the final steps in the production process. Include printing methods in the **About section** of your **Maker Profile**.
  * Custom vinyl and stickers are permitted as long as they are original designs, cut and created by you in your studio.
  * Unauthorized copies or reproductions of artwork that violate any copyright or trademark are not allowed. Read more about [Intellectual Property for Rights Owners](/gp/help/GU5SQCEKADDAQRLZ).
