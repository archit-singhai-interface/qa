In addition to your default help pages, you can create custom product-specific
help pages. These can be associated with existing products in your catalog.
For example, if you are selling a shirt, you can add specific seller content
about sizing specifications for that shirt.  
  
  1. From the **Settings** drop-down menu, select **Your Info & Policies**. 

  2. Click **Custom Help Pages**.

  3. In the **Custom Help Page Title** text box, enter your Help topic title, such as "Sizing Information" or "Assembly Instructions."

  4. In the **Custom Help Page Body** text box, add your product-specific help page text.

  5. To add an image to the page, click **Select/Upload Image** at the bottom of the page.  
You will be directed to **Upload Your Custom Help Page Image**.

  6. Click **Browse** , select the custom help page image from your computer, and then click **Upload**. Your image will be sent to the Amazon servers. 

  7. Click **Save**.

If your submission exceeds 10,000 characters (including blank spaces), you
will receive an error message. To meet the requirements, you can create
multiple help pages for different topics or types of products, particularly if
you are providing sizing charts.
