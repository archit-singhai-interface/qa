When you choose a category for your products, make sure that you learn about
the specific requirements and guidelines for selling in that category.

**Note:** To learn more about the product categories that are available, see
[Overview of categories](/gp/help/200332540).

  * **Condition Guidelines:** Some categories have guidelines that describe the condition of products that you list as new, used, or refurbished. For more information, go to [Condition Guidelines](/gp/help/200339950).
  * **Style guides:** Most categories have style guides that can help you create great product titles and descriptions. Category style guides are downloadable PDF files that contain site requirements for images, product descriptions, and more. For more information, go to [Product page style guides](/gp/help/200270100).
  * **Restricted products:** Some products are restricted and cannot be sold on the Amazon website under any conditions. Review [Restricted products](/gp/help/200164330) for a comprehensive list.
  * **Categories that require approval:** Some categories require that you get prior approval from Amazon before you can start selling. For more information, go to [Categories and products that require approval](/gp/help/G200333160).
  * **Required product identifiers:** Most categories require a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), such as a UPC, EAN or JAN, as a product identifier. You can request exemptions in certain categories. For more information, go to [Listing requirements: Product IDs (GTINs)](/gp/help/200317470).

To list products in the following categories, you generally do not require
pre-approval. However, we do restrict some aspects of selling in these
categories:

  * Media Products: See [Categories and products that require approval](/gp/help/G200333160).
  * Software and Video Games: Only approved sellers can list certain products. See [Sell software](/gp/help/200386270).
