4 For services offered through [Amazon Local
Selling](https://sell.amazon.com/programs/local-selling).

## Rental book service fee

The [rental book service fee](/gp/help/GQ7JD2CPGVTZV2WH) is $5.00 per book
rented to a customer.

## Closing fees

Sellers also pay a [closing fee](/gp/help/GKD9U5REK5DKB38Y) of $1.80 per item
that is sold in the categories of Books, DVD, Music, Software & Computer/Video
Games, Video Game Consoles, and Video Game Accessories.

## High-volume listing fee

We charge a monthly [high-volume listing fee](/gp/help/G7942GMW2RET3WDG) of
$0.001 per eligible SKU to cover our system costs associated with cataloging
and maintaining large numbers of SKUs on Amazon.com.

To help you grow the selection of products you offer on Amazon, we waive the
high-volume listing fee for the first 1.5 million SKUs. All SKUs across all
product categories, irrespective of creation date or sales history, will be
counted towards the fee. We apply a listing fee of $0.001 for each SKU per
month on the SKUs in excess of the initial 1.5 million. We apply the fee to
your highest number of eligible SKUs from the fifth day through the thirty-
first day of the month.

For example, if you offer 1.6 million SKUs in December 2020, we will charge
you a fee of $100 for the month of December, calculated as $0.001 on the
100,000 SKUs that were above your free allowance of 1.5 million SKUs. You can
view the number of eligible SKUs by going to the **Reports tab** in Seller
Central, selecting **Inventory Reports** , and then selecting **High Volume
Listings Report** from the drop-down menu on the page. The fee will be
calculated and charged monthly, and will be displayed in the next month's
statement.

## Refund administration fee

If you refund a customer for an order for which you have already received
payment, Amazon will refund you the amount of the referral fee you paid for
the item(s), minus the applicable [refund administration
fee](/gp/help/GDC3U6FWF4JJJJC7), which is the lesser of $5.00 or 20% of the
applicable referral fee.

For example, if you refund a customer the $10.00 total sales price of an item
in a category with a 15% referral fee, your refund administration fee will be
$0.30 ($10.00 x 15% referral fee = $1.50).
