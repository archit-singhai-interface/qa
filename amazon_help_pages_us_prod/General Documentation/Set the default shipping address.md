In [Shipping Settings](/sbr#settings), the default shipping address is the
primary physical location, email address, and phone number you use for
shipping orders. This information is saved into your account and will
automatically appear when you select an address in the Buy Shipping
preferences, and Shipping Settings page. You can define multiple shipping
addresses, but you can only set one **Default shipping address** per account.
The setting applies to all services and listings associated with the same
seller account.
