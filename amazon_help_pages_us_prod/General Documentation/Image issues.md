When you upload your image files, we check them to confirm that they meet
technical file requirements. Files that don't meet these requirements arenâ€™t
uploaded to your listings.

Additionally, if the images on your product listings are found to be non-
compliant with Amazon's policies, including the [product detail page
rules](/gp/help/G200390640), the product listings may be removed from search
until you provide a compliant image. For more information on possible image
issues and how to fix them, go to the following pages:

  * To view products that were removed from search due to image issues, go to [Fix your products](/fixyourproducts/suppressed?).
  * To view files that failed to meet technical or Amazon requirements, go to [Submission status](/imaging/upload/status).
  * To learn more about image requirements, go to [Image troubleshooting](/gp/help/G17771).
  * If you're creating your own images, you may find our [imaging products](https://www.amazon.com/pstudioipv) and [photography videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmazonImaging) useful.

**Note:** Images for product detail pages may be sourced from multiple
contributors, to ensure that customers see the best images that are available
and to improve the shopping experience. You can always upload additional
images to your listings. To give your images the highest chance of being
displayed on the detail page, be sure that they comply with our [product image
requirements](/gp/help/G1881).
