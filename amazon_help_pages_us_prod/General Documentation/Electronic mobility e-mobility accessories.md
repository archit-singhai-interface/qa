If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## E-mobility accessories covered by this policy

**E-mobility battery**

A stand-alone replacement battery for e-mobility devices. E-mobility batteries
include any (original or non-original) battery that is sold alone as an
accessory for e-mobility devices.

**E-mobility chargers**

A stand-alone charger for e-mobility devices. E-mobility chargers include any
(original or non-original) chargers that are sold alone as an accessory for
e-mobility devices.

**E-mobility conversion kits**

E-bike conversion kits are designed to convert a normal pedal bike into an
e-bike. They retrofit onto existing pedal bikes rather than integrating the
electric components into the bicycle. The battery is attached externally
rather than hidden in the frame. Cables will run externally between battery,
motor, sensors and controls, with connectors and often cable-ties visible. A
conversion kit may contain several items including a lithium battery. An
e-bike conversion kit has to function like a complete e-bike for legal
reasons.

**E-mobility conversion kit replacement batteries or chargers**

A replacement battery or charger for e-mobility conversion kits. This include
any original or non-original chargers that are sold alone as an accessory for
e-mobility conversion kits.

This policy does not include e-mobility devices. Please visit our policy on
[Electronic mobility (e-mobility)
