Account Health Rating (AHR) indicates your selling account’s risk of
deactivation due to policy non-compliance, and it displays on the seller’s
[Account Health](/performance/dashboard) page for each store in which they
sell worldwide. This page lists all policies included in the AHR, and will be
updated as new policies are added in the future.

Amazon has not changed any policies as a result of AHR, and not all of
Amazon’s policies are currently included in AHR. For a full list of Amazon’s
program policies, go to [Program policies](/gp/help/G521).

We use a combination of advanced machine learning techniques and automation
and expert human review to identify and monitor policy non-compliance and to
respond to reports of illegal products and content. Our tools use natural
language processing and machine learning, which means new information is fed
into them daily and they learn and get better at proactively and automatically
blocking offers we suspect of policy non-compliance.
