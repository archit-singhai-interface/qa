## What countries, regions, and currencies are supported by Seller Wallet for
transfers to my own bank account?

Transfers to your bank account from Seller Wallet can only be made to bank
accounts in the supported countries and regions listed below. This list
differs from the countries, regions, and currencies supported by Amazon
Currency Converter for sellers.

**Note:** Except otherwise noted, transfers can only be made in the local
currency of the country or region where the bank account is located. For
example, if your bank account is located in the US, then transfers can only be
made in USD, even if your bank account is capable of accepting deposits in
more than one currency. If you have a USD bank account opened in Hong Kong,
you can choose to transfer Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) or United States Dollar
(USD) to your bank account. This service is available from your Seller Wallet
account for sellers who have total cross-currency net proceeds ≥ USD 100,000
during the trailing 12 months across all Amazon stores. If you qualify for
this service, you will be able to choose the currency denomination (HKD or
USD) of your Hong Kong bank account when the bank location 'Hong Kong' is
selected while adding a new deposit method.
