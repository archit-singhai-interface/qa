The [Manage Returns tool](/gp/returns/list/ref=xx_myr_favb_xx) on Seller
Central enables you to manage buyer returns and replacement requests for
seller-fulfilled orders across multiple stores.

## Tabs and filters

To navigate the [Manage Returns](/gp/returns/list/ref=xx_myr_favb_xx) page,
use the following tabs:

  * **View all** : Displays return and replacement requests made by your buyers through the Online Returns Center
  * **Pending actions** : Shows open return requests that require you to take follow-up action, such as authorizing a return request, issuing a refund, or uploading a prepaid return-shipping label with tracking
  * **Completed** : Lists return requests that have been completed or closed by you or automatically by Amazon
  * **Returns with A-Z claims** : Displays return requests with A-to-z Guarantee claims that buyers have filed 

To refine your search, use the following filters:

  * **Search bar** : Find specific return or replacement requests by order ID, return merchandise authorization ID, tracking ID, or ASIN. 
  * **Sort by** : Arrange requests by newest or oldest. 
  * **Date range** : Specify a date range for your requests.
  * **Country/region** : Filter requests for one or multiple stores and regions. The **All countries/regions** option is selected by default and allows you to access return or replacement requests for all your stores. You can select or deselect specific stores from the drop-down menu. The store that a return belongs to is indicated in the **Order details** section for each return, under **Marketplace**.

## More information

To view additional details about a specific return, click **More
information**. Here you can see the following information:

  * Item details

## Actions

Several actions are offered for each return or replacement request under the
**Action** column:

  * **Edit authorization** : Most US returns are authorized automatically and given Amazon prepaid labels as per policy. In cases where you're required to authorize a return or provide a return label, choose this action. It also allows you to provide specific return instructions to the buyer, if required.
  * **Issue refund** : Access the refund workflow to issue a full refund or (in the case of a damaged or materially different return) a partial refund by applying a restocking fee. You can also give out concessions in this workflow. 
  * **Complete** : Complete or close a return request. To learn more about the guidelines, go to [Complete or close a return request](/help/hub/reference/GWQ95DQ9UW4EF49F).
  * **Contact buyer** : Communicate directly with the buyer for additional information or to discuss a resolution.
