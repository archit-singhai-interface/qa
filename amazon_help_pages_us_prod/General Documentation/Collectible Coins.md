  3. If seller qualifies as a dealer of precious metals, precious stones, or jewels under 31 C.F.R. Part 1027, seller has implemented an anti-money laundering program in compliance with Federal Regulation 31 C.F.R. § 1027.210, and will, upon Amazon's request, provide copies of seller's anti-money laundering program to Amazon.
