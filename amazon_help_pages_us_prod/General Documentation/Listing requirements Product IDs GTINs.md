For most categories, you are required to provide a unique [product
identifier](/gp/help/G200211450), known as a GTIN (Global Trade Item Number),
to create new listings.

The following are the most commonly used GTINs in the Amazon catalog:

  * Universal Product Code (UPC)
  * International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
  * European Article Number (EAN)
  * Japanese Article Number (JAN)

The specific GTIN required for product page creation and matching varies by
category. The requirements of each category, including exceptions and
exemptions where available, are summarized in the table on the [Product ID
(GTIN) requirements by category](/gp/help/G200317520) Help page.
