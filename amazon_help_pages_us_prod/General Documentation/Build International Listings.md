The [Build International Listings](/global-selling/listings/connect) tool
helps you create and update offers from a single source store to one or more
target stores. You save time and effort by managing offers in one store. From
that source store, the tool will update eligible offers and prices in the
target stores based on settings that you specify and the currency exchange
rates.

Build International Listings works within a region where there are multiple
stores, such as Europe or North America, and across regions when you have
connected them by [linking accounts](/gp/help/201841950).

Build International Listings performs the following automated tasks:

  * Creates offers from a source store to a target store where the same ASINs already exist in both stores.
  * Synchronizes the offer prices in target stores based on the price you set in the source store and your price rules.
  * Adjusts prices periodically to reflect currency conversion fluctuations in the target stores' currencies. The frequency of these updates may vary from daily to weekly. These updates will not show changes of less than 1%.
  * Adds or deletes offers in the target stores when you make changes to eligible ASINs in the source store.
  * Attempts to translate and create product detail pages in a target store.

Build International Listings does not:

  * Guarantee the creation of new product detail pages.
  * Synchronize offers for used products when there is a condition note.
  * Synchronize inventory in the following cases:
    * FBA offers of connections between North American stores — for example, the United States and Canada
    * FBA and seller-fulfilled offers of connections between stores in different regions — for example, North America and Japan
    * FBA offers of connections between the UK and the EU
  * Remove offers in the target store when the offer becomes inactive in the source store.
  * Check that your products comply with applicable laws and regulations across all stores.

**Note:** The easiest way to see if Amazon is translating a product detail
page is to visit the [Build International Listings](/global-
selling/listings/connect) dashboard. For more information, see [Global Offer
Manager](/gp/help/GMF7RM22XQ3FMWA5).

## Create and update offers

  1. Verify that you meet the seller requirements:
     * Professional selling account
     * European Unified Account if using Build International Listings in Europe
     * North America Unified Account if using Build International Listings in North America
     * Linked accounts between regions if using Build International Listings across regions 
     * Accounts in good standing in the stores to be connected

**Note:** The easiest way to tell whether you have a Unified Account or
[linked accounts](/gp/help/202095190) is to click the store switcher at the
top of your selling account and see whether other stores appear.

  2. Verify that your offers meet the following requirements so they can be connected and synchronized:
     * An ASIN must have an active offer in the source store.
     * A product must comply with all applicable laws, and not be [prohibited](/gp/help/201730840) in the target store.
     * A seller must be approved for [restricted products or categories](/gp/help/200333160).

**Note:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that you and your products
comply with all applicable laws of the target stores.

  3. Go to the [Build International Listings](/gp/global-selling/sync-offers) tool and click **Get started**.

  4. Choose your [source and target stores](/gp/help/202121600).

  5. Select offer creation rules or create your own list of offers to be replicated and price-synchronized.

  6. Define your default price rules.

  7. Review your settings.

  8. Wait for Amazon to process the connections. You will get an email when this is complete.

**Note:** If a product detail page with the same ASIN does not exist in the
source and target stores, Amazon will attempt to translate and create the
product detail page in the target stores. Amazon does not guarantee the
creation of a product detail page.

  9. Review the status of your offers on the dashboard and check the [Build International Listings report](/gp/help/202121620).

  10. Update connections and [exclude products](/gp/help/202121630).

  11. Create a connection for a [second source store](/gp/help/202121580) (cross-region connections only).
