If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product

## Pool and spa drain covers covered by this policy

The Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act is a federal law that
establishes design requirements for drain covers (grates), drain
configurations and anti-entrapment systems in public and semi-public swimming
pools and spas. All drain covers sold after December 2008 must comply with the
Act.
