Bullet points highlight the five main features and benefits you want customers
to know about your products. Bullet points help customers quickly understand
if the product is right for them.

**Do not include below information. Bullet points with below information will
be removed or updated:**

  * Special characters such as ™, ®, €, …, †, ‡, o, ¢, £, ¥, ©, ±, ~, â
  * Any emojis such as ☺, ☹, ✅, ❌
  * ASIN number or "not applicable" or "NA" or "n/a" or "N/A", "not eligible", "yet to decide", "to be decided", "TBD", "COPY PENDING"
  * Prohibited phrases such as eco-friendly, environmentally friendly, ecologically friendly, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, Made from Bamboo, contains Bamboo, Made from Soy or contains Soy. For more information, go to [General Listing Restrictions](/gp/help/G201707070)
  * Prohibited guarantee information such as "Full refund" or "If not satisfied, send it back" or "Unconditional guarantee with no limit"
  * Company information, website links, external hyperlinks or any contact
  * Repetition in bullet points. Each bullet point must mention unique product information
  * Include at least three bullet points

**Writing guidelines for high-quality bullet points:**

  * Begin with a capital letter
  * Be formatted as a sentence fragment; don't use end punctuation
  * Use semicolons to separate phrases; within a single bullet point
  * Use more than 10 characters but less than 255 characters
  * Write numbers one to nine in full, excluding names, model numbers, and measurements
  * Add header to bullet point and use ":" as separator before providing complete information 
  * Include a space between a digit and a measurement (for example, 60 ml)
  * Use clear, natural language in the bullet points, avoid stuffing in unnecessary keywords or phrases
  * Highlight product features and benefits, not the brand’s marketing story
  * Highlight how the product meets the customer needs, rather than just listing fact
  * Maintain data consistency across product variants
  * Do not divert or refer to other products not included under this ASIN
  * Remove or minimize duplication across attributes such as title, product description or product overview. Highlight additional or supporting information to help the customer make a more informed decision
  * Avoid any subjective, performance, or comparative claims, unless they are verifiable on the product packaging. Do not compare your product to competitor brands 
  * Avoid claims relating to accolades and awards, unless the product detail page contains supporting details, such as date and awarding body 
  * Avoid claims about the results of consumer surveys, even if the survey collected subjective opinions, unless substantiated with the source and date

  * Long Sleeve: Long sleeves add coverage and style
  * Loose Fit: Relaxed fit allows for easy movement and comfort
  * Machine Washable: Durable construction allows for easy care
