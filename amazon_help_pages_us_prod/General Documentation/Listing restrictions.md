As a seller or advertiser on Amazon, it is your responsibility to comply with
all laws and regulations and with Amazon policies when listing and describing
your products. We provide the following material for informational purposes
only, and it is not intended as legal advice. We encourage you to consult with
your legal counsel for questions about the laws and regulations concerning
your listings.

Selling privileges are commonly restricted or removed if a seller's account
health does not adhere to our performance metrics and policies. Refer to [FBA
product restrictions](/gp/help/G200140860) for additional information.

## Consequences of violation

Violations of Amazon's listing policies may result in actions such as:

  * Cancellation of listings
  * Limits on listing privileges

Amazon reserves the right to make judgments in its sole discretion about
whether or not a listing is appropriate.
