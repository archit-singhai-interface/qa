You can cancel any unshipped items or orders from your [Manage
orders](/gp/orders-v2/list/) page. After you cancel an item or order, Amazon
will send a cancellation email to the buyer.

## Cancel one order

  1. On the **Manage Orders** page, locate the order you want to cancel.

  2. Click **Cancel Order** in the **Action** column.

  3. On the **Cancel Order** page, select a **Reason for Cancellation**. You may also enter any information you want to keep track of in the **Seller memo** field.

  4. Click **Submit**.

## Cancel multiple orders

You can also cancel multiple orders using one of the following techniques:

  * Professional sellers can also cancel multiple orders by uploading an Order Cancellation file. See [Cancel Multiple Orders](/gp/help/50791).

**Note:** We expect sellers to maintain accurate inventory levels. Failure to
adjust your inventory in a timely manner can lead to excessive pre-fulfilment
order cancellations. For information on how we factor cancelled orders into
your overall performance, see [Customer Metrics](/gp/help/200205250).

## Partial refunds

Occasionally, you may need to cancel part of an order with multiple items and
refund the items that are cancelled. If you manage your orders using inventory
files, you can upload an [Order Adjustment Feed](/gp/help/1611).

To cancel or refund part of a multi-item order, follow these steps:

  1. Ship and confirm all of the items that you can fulfill.

  2. Use an [Order Adjustment Feed](/gp/help/200387280) to submit a refund for the order items that you cannot fulfil. Provide the following information in the feed: 
     * Quantity Cancelled: The quantity that cannot be fulfilled.
     * Adjustment Reason: The refund code. Select either **NoInventory** or **CustomerCancel**.

For more information, see [Refund Orders - Order Adjustment
Feed](/gp/help/200387280).
