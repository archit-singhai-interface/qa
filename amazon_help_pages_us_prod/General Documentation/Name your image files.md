The naming requirements on this page apply to the tool used to upload images
in bulk. See [Upload Images](/imaging/upload).

We use the file name of your images to link them with your product's detail
page and to identify them as Main or image variants.

To name your image files, create the file name with three components,
separated from each other by a period. Spaces, dashes, or additional
characters will prevent your image from uploading to Amazon. For example,
NEW-B0001 23456.jpg.

The accepted naming convention is: ASIN + variant code + file extension. For
example, B000123456.MAIN.jpg or B000123456.PT02.jpg.

The variant code is a four-character code that indicates what type of image
you are uploading. Images with no variant code in their name will be treated
as a main image. For example, B000123456.MAIN.jpg or B000123456.jpg will both
be treated as main images.

For additional images, choose a four-character variant code based on the
content of the image. For example, B000123456.PT01.jpg would display part 1,
and B000123456.BACK.jpg would display the back of the product.

**Note:** There is a list of specific variant codes that are accepted by
Amazon. See the below table for the most common variant codes. If you receive
an incorrect file name error, but you followed the correct naming convention,
your product is yet to be active on the Amazon catalog.
