The **Catalog** workspace provides a custom set of tools for prioritization,
management, and enhancement of item data through your Seller Central account.
Item data for a product is attribute information that is common for all
sellers; for example, brand name, color, material of a product.

The **Complete drafts** section under the **Catalog** menu is your workspace
to view and edit your draft listings. Any listings that tod not meet listing
policies at the time of submission are stored as drafts, so you can view and
work on them at your convenience. These drafts are saved in your account until
you provide missing data or correct invalid data, at which time draft listings
are reprocessed.

You can add missing data or correct invalid data for your drafts one at a time
or in bulk. Additionally, you can export an Excel file containing your draft
listings and add data to those drafts while uploading the file to Seller
Central. For more information, see [Upload your inventory
file](/gp/help/201576670).

To take action on your drafts, you can do the following:

  * Edit single or multiple attributes using inline editable fields
  * Edit drafts using the Add a Product tool
  * Edit multiple drafts using bulk options

##  Use inline editable fields

To edit drafts using the editable fields, complete the following steps:  

  1. Click the highlighted attribute field(s) next to a listing.
  2. Enter or edit the data for a particular attribute. For more information about valid values, click the question mark symbol next to the field.
  3. Click **Save** next to the field to save the data for a single attribute.
  4. Click **Save X values** to save data for multiple attributes for a listing. 

##  Use the Add a Product tool

To add drafts using the **Add a Product** tool, complete the following steps:  

  1. Click **Edit draft** next to any draft listing. The **Add a Product** page appears.
  2. Provide valid values for all the attributes highlighted in red.
  3. Click **Save.**

You can add data to the attributes that we have identified and any other
optional attributes using this form to re-upload your draft for processing.

To edit multiple drafts, complete the following steps:
