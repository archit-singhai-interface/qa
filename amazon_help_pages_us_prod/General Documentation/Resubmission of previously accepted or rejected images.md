An image will fail to upload if the exact file has previously been submitted
for this product.

Make sure that you do not upload the exact same image for the same product
multiple times.

If your product does not have an image on the website, it is probably due to
the image previously failing to upload because it did not meet technical file
requirements. Upload a file that meets all image requirements.

For more information on image requirements, refer to the below resources:
