If we determine that additional information is required during an A-to-z
Guarantee Claim investigation, we will contact you via email with a request
for more information and provide a Claim notification on your Seller Central
homepage that requires your attention. This may include but is not limited to
the following information:

  * For delivery-related Claims: Dispatch method, proof of delivery, tracking number, customer’s delivery address, customer’s signature confirmation, and carrier details.
  * For returns related Claims: Domestic return address, returns shipping details (such as a prepaid return label), and information about why a particular return request was closed (such as why it was rejected) and not authorized.
  * Any correspondence between you and the customer that demonstrates your communication with the customer (including if the customer provided an acknowledgement of receipt of the order or indicated satisfaction with the transaction).

If you do not respond to our request for additional information within 72
hours, we will grant the Claim in favor of the customer, and your account will
be debited for the Claim amount. If granted in favor of the customer, the
Claim will reflect in your account health or order defect rate (ODR) metrics.
Review our [Order Defect Rate](/gp/help/200285170) (ODR) help page for more
information on how Claims impacts your account health.

To respond to a Claim notification:  

  1. From the **Performance** menu, select [A-to-z Guarantee Claims](/gp/guarantee-claims/home.html?language=en_US&ref=ag_gclaims_cont_G1781).
  2. In the **Action required** tab (which is the default tab), find the relevant claim and select **Respond to Amazon**.
  3. Enter your comments in the text box and include any information that may help us better understand the Claim and your position on whether it should be granted.

**Note:** The text box does not support attachments. Use [Buyer-Seller
Messages](/messaging/inbox-v2?ct=&fi=RESPONSE_NEEDED&bt=&nt=&pn=1&pd=NONE&sd=&ed=&si=)
if you want to attach documents to send to the customer, and then state in
your response that you have attached additional information (such as print on
demand) in Buyer-Seller Messages.

  4. Click **Submit**.

We encourage you to regularly check your email so you're aware of when you

or personal injury caused by a defective product, go to [A-to-z Claims Process
for Property Damage and Personal Injury](/gp/help/GTY6NYZDFD5CENYH).

**Note:** The A-to-z Guarantee is different for Amazon Pay transactions. You
can review the [Amazon A-to-z Guarantee for
merchants](https://pay.amazon.com/us/help/201212410) on the Amazon Pay
website.

**Important:** If Amazon grants a Claim in favor of a customer, you have 30
days to [appeal](/gp/help/G202041210) and request a further investigation.
Based on the results of the appeals investigation, Amazon will make a decision
on whether to reverse the initial decision and reimburse you for the Claim
incurred. For more information about Claims, go to [Amazon’s A to-z Guarantee
Claims](/gp/help/G27951).
