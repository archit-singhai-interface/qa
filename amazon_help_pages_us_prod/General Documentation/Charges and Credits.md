## Trip Charges

A Trip Charge, or a service fee is a common flat fee associated with the cost
of time and travel required to inspect and/or complete a service. This fee is
now absorbed into the cost of doing business, however, under certain
circumstances, you may be eligible for a Trip Credit.

## Trip Credits

A service order may be eligible for a Trip Credit when a technician has sent
an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) notification and arrives to a customer’s
appointment within the scheduled appointment slot and:

Issue | Requirements  
---|---  
Customer did not show up | 

  * ETA notification was sent at least 30 min before the appointment time (Arrival Window)
  * Appointment was not rescheduled previously by the service provider
  * Technician arrived (started the appointment) within the Arrival Window
  * Technician called Services Central Ops (SCO) requesting a 3-way call with unsuccessful customer contact
  * Notes in Seller Central state that the customer was a No show when the tech arrived to the address

  
Customer no longer needs the service | 

  * ETA notification was sent at least 30 min before the appointment time (Arrival Window)
  * Technician arrived (started the appointment) within the arrival window
  * Customer has not made a cancellation or reschedule request via email before the appointment date
  * Customer request to the Technician must have been done the day of the appointment after the ETA was sent. ROC (Room of Choice) reschedule must have been done the day/time of the appointment
  * Notes in Seller Central state the customer’s request for cancellation or reschedule. In case of reschedule, date and time of requested reschedule must be in the notes. If it was rescheduled due to ROC issue, that should be mentioned in the notes.
  * ASINs requiring two people had two people assigned to the order

  
Work is different than scoped and order cannot be completed | 

  * ETA notification was sent at least 30 min before the appointment time (Arrival Window)
  * Technician arrived (started the appointment) within the Arrival Window
  * Notes in Seller Central are detailed and explicit as to why the job is considered out of scope 

  
Product is defective or missing parts  | 

  * ETA notification was sent at least 30 min before the appointment time (Arrival Window)
  * Technician arrived (started the appointment) within the Arrival Window
  * Order has not been rescheduled previously due to product being defective/damaged/missing parts
  * Technician contacted SCO to report the issue with the product
  * Notes in Seller Central are detailed describing the problem with the product

  
Product not delivered | 

  * ETA notification was sent at least 30 min before the appointment time (Arrival Window)
  * Technician arrived (started the appointment) within the arrival window
  * Notes in Seller Central state that the product had not been delivered to customer

  
  
If there is no evidence of an ETA message, and if the requirements depending
on the issue are not met, the Trip Credit request will be denied.

## Ad-Hoc Charges

Occasionally there are scenarios where, instead of passing on a charge to the
customer through a [Change
Order](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G202146150), it’s appropriate
to charge Amazon. The following are reasons where an Ad-Hoc Charge may be
appropriate:

Issue | Requirements  
---|---  
Additional quantities of the same product | 

  * Multiple quantities of the same item with only one service attached. Note that customer requests for additional assembly/services for the additional items should be addressed via [Change Order](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/202146150?ie=UTF8) with the customer’s approval.
  * Notes in Seller Central explicitly state the number of additional items that were assembled

  
Incorrect ASIN ordered (product attached)  | 

  * Used in instances where the incorrect service type is attached to a product. Note that services with no product attached should be addressed with the customer via [Change Order](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/202146150?ie=UTF8) with the customer’s approval.
  * Notes in Seller Central must clearly state the issue

  
Room of Choice (ROC) | 

  * Used in instances where the technician called SCO to confirm that the customer paid for ROC at delivery. Note that if the customer did not pay for ROC the $20 fee for moving the product to the correct location should be addressed via [Change Order](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/202146150?ie=UTF8) with the customer’s approval.
  * Order is completed (not cancelled)
  * Notes in Seller Central state that the item was moved by the Technician(s) to the customer’s room of choice

  
Follow up appointment | 

  * There is a Happiness Guarantee Claim (HGC) related to the appointment and it is determined that the Provider is NOT at fault
  * The order is completed in Seller Central

  
  
## Notating Seller Central

It is critical that accurate notes are placed in Seller Central, so Trip
Credit or Ad-Hoc Charge requests can be reviewed timely and accurately.
Notations should include:  

  1. Today’s date
  2. Initials of the person leaving the notation
  3. Date and time of the event

Example: _“Customer no show, called SCO at 5.30 pm on April 4 and customer did
not answer. SB 4/5/22”_
