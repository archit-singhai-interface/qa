## Delivery Service Introduction

  * E-Packet is China Post's standard direct delivery service for the cross-border e-commerce light and small items, limiting weight of 2 KG (UK 5KG). The service cooperates with destination local postal services, and uses the postal channel EDI to quickly clear customs, providing tracking information and delivery confirmation.
  * E-Courier is a cross-border logistics solution designed by China Post to integrate high-quality resources from domestic and overseas channels, specifically targeting various situations in different countries and regions. The service uses a commercial customs clearance mode, which may deliver products with batteries, provide compensation and return services. It includes:
    * E-Courier Parcel last mile uses the standard class delivery network and provides delivery confirmation. E-Courier Parcel special may deliver items with batteries with a weight limit of 30 KG.
    * E-courier Packet last mile uses the economy class delivery network and provides “out for delivery” tracking information. E-Courier Packet special may deliver items with batteries with a weight limit of 2 KG.
  * E-EMS is an international express service designed and operated by China Post, which is suitable for international EMS deliveries for the high-weight (more than 2 KG) and high-value (US $50) items for cross-border e-commerce. The service adopts a fee calculation model with a starting weight of 50 gram and an additional fee based on additional weight. The internal processing approach is essentially the same as the standard international EMS, providing full tracking information and delivery confirmation.

in Buy Shipping is the public rate offered by China Post. The rate you will
