The requirements and limitations below apply to the reimbursement of
Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees that we determine were charged using
inaccurate weight or dimensions. This policy does not apply to other fee
reimbursements.

Amazon will reimburse the FBA fees if we confirm that they were charged using
inaccurate weight or dimensions. When the weight or dimensions that the seller
provides vary from our verified measurement, our measurement will govern.

**Important:** To be eligible for reimbursement under this policy, you must
submit your request within 90 days of the date on which the fee was charged.

A product is not eligible for a remeasurement request if any of the following
conditions apply:

  * It has already been remeasured twice in the past 60 days by our fulfillment center team.
  * There are no available units for your listing in the fulfillment center.
  * Your seller account has exceeded the monthly remeasurement request limit.

For more information, go to [Understanding item package weight and
dimensions](/gp/help/G6WAEPTECPT2JUH3).

##  Submitting your request

If you have reviewed the weight and dimension data in a fee report and you
still believe it is inaccurate, contact Selling Partner Support and open a
research request.

To request a remeasurement, type "remeasure" into the search box and follow
the instructions in the widget.

Before you submit your request, complete the following steps:  

  1. Get the weight and dimension data used in the FBA fee calculation from the corresponding fee report, such as the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/reportcentral/STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES/1) or the [Aged Inventory Surcharge report](/reportcentral/LONGTERM_STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES/0).
  2. Review those dimensions to determine if they differ from what you had expected.

**Note:** For each fee charge, you may file only one claim. Additional claims
for the same fee charge will be declined.

Only one request needs to be created for an FNSKU and need not create separate
requests for every order within the FNSKU.

We need 10 days to review the request, we will notify you if you are eligible
for reimbursement after reviewing the request
