You can change the settings selection for a target store by following these
steps:

  

  1. Go to the [Build International Listings](/gp/global-selling/sync-offers/) tool.
  2. If you have set up a second source store, you will need to select the source store for which you want to add a target store using the store switcher at the top of the page before you proceed.
  3. Click the **Edit** button to the right of the source store.
  4. Follow the workflow to [create a connection using Build International Listings](/gp/help/202121580) to edit the settings for the target store for the selected source store.

Processing and creation of offers may take up to 4 hours to complete. After
the target store connections have been updated, a Status Report will be
generated and available on the **Build International Listings Manage
Connections** page. You will receive an email informing you that the process
is complete with a summary of the results. [Learn more](/gp/help/202121620)

FBA offers require you to send inventory to the target store fulfillment
center to activate them. To manage your inventory, select **FBA Inventory**
from the **Inventory** menu in Seller Central.

**Note:** If you are using the self-fulfilled method, it is recommended that
you review your shipping settings for each store to ensure that you are
setting the rates that meet your requirements. To adjust shipping settings,
change the store using the store switcher. Shipping settings can be accessed
from the **Settings** menu in Seller Central.
