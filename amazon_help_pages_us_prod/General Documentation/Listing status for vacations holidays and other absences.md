If you can’t fulfill orders for any reason (family emergency, inclement
weather, going on holiday or vacation, etc.), you can change your Listings
Status to Inactive. This will remove your self-fulfilled listings from Amazon
product detail pages and search results within one hour. When you are ready to
sell again, you can change the status of your listings back to Active.

**Note:**

This page provides instructions on how to change the status of your self-
fulfilled listings in the event that you can’t fulfill orders. If you are
trying to troubleshoot an issue with a listing not related to vacation
settings, see the following Help pages instead:

  * [My ASIN is Unsearchable](/gp/help/GHGHDMU4X5K9QGCV)
  * [Fix a no listing error](/gp/help/G200252930)
  * [Reasons for blocked listings](/gp/help/GGGKKCTPTVTF95E5)
  * [Unblock listings that have pricing errors](/gp/help/G201686950)

Before changing the status of your listings, check for any pending orders,
since these will not automatically be canceled. You might want to set your
listing status to Inactive prior to the date you will be away, since pending
orders may take time to resolve.

  1. From your seller account, select **Settings** , then select **Account Info**. 

  2. Go to **Account Overview** , in the **Store Status** section, click **Vacation Settings**.

  3. On the **Vacation Settings** page, you can change your settings for one or multiple marketplaces, as detailed in the following table:

Do you sell in one marketplace or multiple marketplaces? | Your available options  
---|---  
**If you only sell in one marketplace** | If you sell in one marketplace, the marketplace will appear along with an **Active** and **Inactive** radio button (gray circle). You have two options:
     * To remove your listings from the Amazon catalog, select the **Inactive** radio button, and then click **Save**.
     * To add your listings to the Amazon catalog, select the **Active** radio button, and then click **Save**.  
**If you sell in multiple marketplaces** | If you sell in multiple marketplaces, you will see the marketplaces listed. You can then choose to change the listing status for all marketplaces or individual marketplaces:
     * To set listings in **all marketplaces** to active or inactive: click the **Active** or **Inactive** button at the top of the table and then click **Save**.
     * To set listings in **individual marketplaces** to active or inactive: click the **Active** or **Inactive** radio button (gray circle) next to each marketplace in the table and then click **Save**.  
  

Wait one hour for your changes to take effect on Amazon product detail pages
and search results. If you have any Fulfillment by Amazon listings, they will
remain active on Amazon.

**Note:** Any applicable monthly subscription fees will continue to be
charged, even if the fees are due while your listings are inactive. If you
don’t want to be charged a monthly subscription fee, you can choose to
downgrade your account from a Professional selling plan to an Individual
selling plan. For more information, see [Selling plan
comparison](/gp/help/G64491).

**Note:** Listings Status can only be edited by users who have been granted
the right to manage inventory.

**Note:** Vacation settings are not applicable to Amazon Pay.

## Things to remember while your listings are inactive

You must process return requests and respond to messages from customers within
24 hours, even if your listings are set to Inactive. You can update your
settings to receive return request emails with links to Authorize, Close, or
Reply, and you can have Amazon automatically authorize return requests. Learn
more about [automating returns](/gp/help/G200828040).

You can still create and edit listings while your listings are Inactive.
Additions and changes will be reflected on Amazon when you change your
Listings Status back to Active.

## Changing listings back to active

When you are ready to sell again, change your Listings Status back to active
by repeating the steps above on the [Vacation Settings](/hz/account-
info/vacation-settings?ref_=macs_gvacatn_cont_acinfohm) page. This time select
**Active** instead of Inactive and your listings will reappear within one
hour.
