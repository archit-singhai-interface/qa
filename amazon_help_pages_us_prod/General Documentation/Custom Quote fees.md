**Important:** The following fee structure for Custom Quote is part of a pilot
that was launched on February 22, 2022. You will be notified of any changes to
the pilot program at least 60 days in advance. This fee structure is only
available to sellers participating in the [Custom Quote
program](/gp/help/GEPUV45QETRB3WVV) and not the Quantity Discount program.

Custom Quote enables business customers to connect with a trusted network of
sellers and receive favorable offers for their bulk purchasing needs. For
sellers, it gives you the opportunity to connect with business customers and
participate in bulk deals.

This page will give you an insight on the fee structure for transactions
processed through the Custom Quote program and other relevant information.

## Referral fees

For all products, Amazon deducts the applicable referral fee percentage
calculated on the total sales price, excluding any taxes calculated through
Amazon tax calculation services. The total sales price is the total amount
paid by the customer, including the item price and any delivery fees.

Referral fees vary by category, as described on the [Referral fees
page](/gp/help/GTG4BAWSY39Z98Z3).

On February 22, 2022, Amazon Business launched a pilot fee structure for
Custom Quote transactions. This structure will continue through the end of
this year. During this period, the fees that you pay will be calculated based
on the following Custom Quote rates:

Custom Quote value in dollars | Fee applied*  
---|---  
$1 to $10,000 | X%**  
From $10,001 to $50,000 | 7%  
From $50,001 to $100,000 | 6%  
From $100,001 and above | 5%  
  
*This referral fee structure is valid exclusively for seller-fulfilled orders and is subject to changes during the pilot period. The percentages are based on referral fees by category. You can view the current rates on [Referral fees](/gp/help/GTG4BAWSY39Z98Z3). 

**The referral fee applied to the first $10,000 of the quote will be based on
the [referral fee rates](/gp/help/GTG4BAWSY39Z98Z3) for each category.

## Fee calculation example

The example below explains the fee calculation based on this fee structure for
a custom quote response for kitchen products.

Seller XYZ has received a custom quote request for coffee mugs from an Amazon
Business customer. Custom quote requests appear on the **Manage Quotes** page
in Seller Central.

The customer wants to spend $250,000 on this buy. The seller wants to reply to
the request with an offered quote, but would like to estimate the fee to be
paid for the sale.

The following is an example of the estimation of the fees for this sale, per
the Custom Quote rates:

  * For the first $10,000 of this sale, the seller will pay a 15% fee, based on the [referral fee rate for the category](/gp/help/GTG4BAWSY39Z98Z3), which is equivalent to $1,500. 
  * For the next $40,000 of the sale, per the Custom Quote rate, the seller will pay $2,798. 
  * For the next $50,000 of the sale, the seller will pay $3,000, and for the remaining $150,000, the seller will pay $7,500. 

The total fee to be paid is $14,780.

Based on the previous fee rates for Custom Quote, the seller would have paid
$37,500 ($250,000 x 15%). But with this fee structure, the seller will save
$22,720.

The following table provides a breakdown of this fee calculation:

Custom Quote value in dollars | Example referral fee percentage | Example referral fee calculation | Example referral fee to collect  
---|---|---|---  
$1 to $10,000 | 15% | $10,000 x 15% | $1,500  
From $10,000 to $50,000 | 7% | $40,000 x 7% | $2,780  
From $50,000 to $100,000 | 6% | $50,000 x 6% | $3,000  
From $100,000 and above | 5% | $150,000 x 5% | $7,500  
**Total collected fee** | **5.9%** |  | **$14,780**  
  
**Note:** We will keep you informed of any changes to the pilot program at
least 60 days in advance.

## Frequently asked questions

#### When are the Custom Quote fees valid?

The Custom Quote fees are only valid when the seller receives a custom quote
request. You can always review the available requests via the Custom quote
requests page.

In Seller Central, select **Manage Quotes** from the **B2B** drop-down menu,
and then click **Custom quote requests** to review available requests.
Alternatively, you can also view the **Manage Quotes** widget on the Seller
Central home page.

#### How will I know if there’s a fee change for Custom Quote?

Custom Quote fees are subject to change during the pilot period. Any changes
to the fees, other than material aspects of the pilot program, will be
communicated to you 60 days in advance.

#### What happens if a customer requests multiple items from the same seller?

Custom Quote fees apply per product, which means that the fee will be
calculated on the total amount that’s requested per product and not on the
addition of distinct quotes together. For example, if a customer creates a
custom quote for two products, one for $50,000 and another for $30,000, the
fees will be calculated individually for each quote.

#### How is the fee discount calculated for a multiple-item quote request?

The logic for applying referral fee discounts is determined at the ASIN level,
depending on the specific ASIN and the deal value that you choose to respond
to.

#### What happens if I have a recurring contract with a customer? Will the
transactions be aggregated to calculate the fees?

No, it is important to consider that fees will be charged for each transaction
individually.

#### Will I be able to view a fee calculation screen, or fee explainer, per
custom quote order like the one that I’m able to view for regular orders?

This feature is not available for Custom Quote at this time. We’re working on
developing an extra tool to help you understand how fees are calculated.

#### What do I do if I think that my fee wasn’t calculated accurately?

If you believe that there was a mistake with how your fees were calculated,
email us at [Quoting-Concierge@amazon.com](mailto:Quoting-
Concierge@amazon.com) or contact your account manager for further
clarification.

#### What if my order qualifies for more than one discounted fee structure?

Amazon will charge the lowest of the fee structure that your order qualifies
for.

#### What if I have additional questions about Custom Quote fees?

You can email us at [Quoting-Concierge@amazon.com](mailto:Quoting-
Concierge@amazon.com), or contact your account manager.
