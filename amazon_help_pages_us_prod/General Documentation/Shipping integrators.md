If you're a seller on a Professional selling plan, you can access [Buy
Shipping](G200202220) through the [Amazon Marketplace Web
Service](https://developer.amazonservices.com/), with the [Merchant
Fulfillment API](G201950090). Amazon Marketplace Web Service enables
developers to build applications that let sellers use Amazon's Buy Shipping
outside of Seller Central.

You can also buy shipping labels by using an eligible third-party shipping
integrator that has adopted Amazon's Merchant Fulfillment API. For many
integrators, the process is as easy as one click. The Amazon Seller Central
Partner Network is a directory of approved third-party Software and Service
Partners who are innovating on behalf of Amazon sellers. Go to [Amazon Seller
Central Partner Network](/partnernetwork) to find shipping solutions.

If you are currently using a shipping integrator that is not listed, contact
your integrator to find out if they have already adopted the API, or their
timeline to adopt.

Sellers access to Buy Shipping for Seller Fulfilled Prime and Non-Prime
