The Date Range reports include individual transaction reports and summary
reports for orders within a specific range, based on the date when
transactions were posted to your account. This may not correspond to the order
date or the shipment date.

**Important:** The Date Range reports capture all of the transactions between
the first report date at 12:00 a.m. to the last report date at 11:59 p.m.
local time

Follow these steps to generate a custom Date Range report:

  1. From the **Payments** drop-down menu, select [Reports Repository](/payments/reports-repository).

  2. On this page, select the account type, if applicable. If you have multiple account types, you can select **All** to generate unified reports for all of your available accounts.

  3. Select one of the following report types: 
     * The **Summary report** (PDF) is an overview of income, expenses, taxes, and fund transfers in your seller account during a specific date range.
     * The **Transaction report** (CSV) is a detailed list of the transactions that occurred in your seller account during a specific date range.

  4. Select one of the following date ranges:
     * The **Month** option will generate a report from the first to the end of the selected month. Select a month and year from the drop-down menus. You can select a previous month or a future month up to one year in the future.
     * The **Custom date range** option will allow you to select any dates of your choice. Use the date pickers to specify the start and end dates for your report.

**Note:** If you select an end date in the future, your report will only be
generated 24 hours after that end date. Reports can be generated for up to 365
days at a time, going as far back as 2012.

  5. Click **Request report**.

Reports can take up to three hours to generate. If you do not see your report
in the list yet, check again later.
