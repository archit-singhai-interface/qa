An item can show up in many different product categories on the Amazon retail
site to help customers discover your product. To calculate referral fees, we
choose a single category that we have determined is most applicable to your
product and all others like it. For a list of referral fees by product type,
see [Selling on Amazon Fee Schedule](/gp/help/200336920).
