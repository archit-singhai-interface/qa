This page provides an overview of problems that may be identified with
shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers. To see trends and to troubleshoot
problems that have been identified over the past 120 days, go to the [Shipment
Performance
dashboard](/fba/inboundperformancedashboard?ref=fbacentral_nav_fba). To
generate or download your problem reports for the past 365 days, go to the
[Inbound Performance report](/reportcentral/INBOUND_NONCOMPLIANCE/0).

Additional coaching or product prep requires resources. For repeated problems
in the same problem group, Amazon will escalate your coaching level
(**standard** , **elevated** , **critical**). For details about coaching-level
escalations and their corresponding corrective actions by problem type, go to
[Performance coaching](/gp/help/G5H26MCVJG4B82ST).

## Problem group: Inaccurate tracking information

Problem type | Problem description | How to avoid the problem  
---|---|---  
**Missing tracking information** | One or more of your shipments didn’t have tracking information uploaded before the shipment was delivered to the fulfillment center. | Upload tracking information for all non-partnered carrier shipments as soon as your carrier provides it to you and before the shipment is delivered to the fulfillment center. For small-parcel deliveries, upload a tracking ID for each box. For less-than-truckload (LTL) and full-truckload (FTL) deliveries, upload a freight progressive number for each shipment. You can upload tracking information in your [Shipping Queue](/gp/ssof/shipping-queue.html) by clicking **Track shipment**.  
**Incorrect tracking information (small-parcel shipments)** | Some or all of the tracking identifiers for this shipment were incorrect. For each box in a small parcel shipment, we require the carrier’s tracking identifier that was on the box before the shipment entered "Receiving" status. | 

  * Select the correct carrier when choosing transportation options in Send to Amazon. If you need to change the carrier, you can do so in the final step, **Tracking details**.
  * Enter tracking information as soon as your carrier provides it to you. 
  * Ensure that tracking information corresponds to the correct box in the shipment.
  * For international shipments, enter tracking information for the final stage of the shipment (for example, from the port of entry to the destination Amazon fulfillment center).

  
  
## Problem group: On-time arrival

Problem type | Problem description | How to avoid the problem  
---|---|---  
**Missed delivery window** | Over 10% of units from your shipment did not arrive at designated fulfillment centers within the provided delivery window. Failure to deliver within the provided delivery window affects our ability to plan FBA operation for efficient receiving. This can lead to delays in stocking and selling products. | 

  * Remember that FBA has a 7-day delivery window policy for domestic shipments and a 14-day window for international shipments, and plan accordingly. 
  * Provide an accurate delivery window during shipment creation, and then deliver within the window accordingly.
  * In case of any changes, make sure to update your delivery window information by clicking **Edit window** in the Send to Amazon **Tracking details** step before the start of the input window.
  * For more information, go to [Send to Amazon: Delivery window](/gp/help/G4ZKN4DCCXL5XQWJ).
