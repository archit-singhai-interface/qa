**Important:** If you supply products for sale on Amazon, you must comply with
all federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to those
products and product listings.

You are generally permitted to sell radio frequency devices that (1) are legal
for sale, (2) operate in accordance with their authorization, (3) comply with
applicable industry standards, and (4) do not interfere with other
electronics.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates
electronic devices that can emit radio frequency energy (“radio frequency
devices,” or “RF devices”). These devices have the potential to interfere with
authorized radio communications, and must be authorized under the appropriate
FCC procedure before they can be marketed, imported, or used in the United
States.

Examples of devices that require FCC authorization include, but are not
limited to:

  * Wi-Fi devices
  * Bluetooth devices
  * Mobile phones
  * Electronic tablets and other devices with cellular connectivity
  * Two-way radios and walkie talkies
  * Automatic identification system (AIS) devices
  * Broadcast transmitters
  * Signal boosters

RF devices offered for sale on Amazon must be authorized using the appropriate
FCC equipment authorization procedure. For more information, please see
<https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/rfdevice> and
<https://www.fcc.gov/general/equipment-authorization-procedures>.

## Examples of prohibited listings

  * Radio frequency devices that require FCC certification but have not yet been FCC certified
  * Radio frequency devices that are subject to authorization under the Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) procedure but are not authorized through either SDoC or FCC certification
  * Radio frequency devices that claim to be authorized under the Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) procedure but do not have a responsible party for compliance in the United States
  * Automatic identification system (AIS) devices designed or intended for purposes other than marine navigation safety communications, such as tracking fishing nets
  * Signal boosters intended for use in large industrial or commercial spaces, such as warehouses, stadiums, airports, office buildings, hospitals, tunnels, and educational campuses
  * Power amplifiers used with Citizens Band (CB) radios
  * Products designed to intentionally block, jam or interfere with licensed or authorized radio communications, such as cell, GPS, laser, PCS, radar, or Wi-Fi jammers; GPS repeaters; and radar shifters
  * Wireless microphones that operate in the 600 MHz Band (617-652 MHz and 663-698 MHz) or 700 MHz Band (698-806 MHz)
