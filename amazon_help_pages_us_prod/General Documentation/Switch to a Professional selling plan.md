Amazon offers a [selling plan comparison](/gp/help/G64491). You can easily
switch your existing selling plan.

To learn about switching from a Professional selling plan to an Individual
selling plan, see [Switch to an Individual selling plan](/gp/help/G201710030).

To switch from an Individual selling plan to a Professional selling plan:

  1. From your seller account, click **Settings** , and then select **Account Info**.

  2. On the left side, under **Seller Account Information** , go to the **Your Services** section and click [Manage](/gp/express-boarding/mys-wizard-mode/components/manage-your-services.html?ref_=macs_modplan_cont_acinfohm).

  3. In the **Sell on Amazon** row, under the **You are signed up for** section, click **Upgrade**.

  4. Review the terms on the next page, and then click **Proceed to Upgrade**. You will be returned to **Your Services**. A message will appear indicating that the upgrade process has started.

**Note:** To help us maintain a trusted marketplace for buyers and sellers, we
review all requests to upgrade a selling plan and will ask you to provide
additional documentation. After we receive your upgrade request, you will
receive an email within 72 hours with information on how to provide this
documentation. After we receive the documents, the review process can last up
to three business days. We will suspend your existing listings while we review
your request.

Your Professional selling plan subscription begins immediately after
upgrading. Additional links to Professional selling tools appear in your
account right away, but some billing features can take up to two days to
activate.

If you are re-upgrading or upgrading for the first time, see [Downgrade or
upgrade and tax calculation service](/gp/help/G202101950).

When the upgrade process is complete and you have moved to the Professional
selling plan, you will no longer be charged a per-item fee. The first
subscription fee is charged against the available balance in your seller
account. After that, the subscription fee is charged monthly.

**Note:** If the available balance in your seller account is insufficient, the
remaining amount will be charged to your credit card.

To view the monthly subscription fee:

  1. On the **Reports** menu, select **Payments**.

  2. Do one of the following:
     * Click **Statement View** tab. Your monthly subscription fee appears next to **Selling Fees**.
     * Click **Transaction View** tab. Select **Service Fees** from the drop-down menu.
