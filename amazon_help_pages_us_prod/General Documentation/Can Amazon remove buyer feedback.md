As a general rule, Amazon does not remove buyer feedback even if it is
unwarranted or the issue has been resolved.

However, there are some situations when Amazon may remove or strike-through
buyer feedback. In such situations, if your request is granted, the impact of
the feedback will be removed from your feedback rating and Order Defect Rate
[Order Defect Rate](/gp/help/G200285170) (ODR). Following are the scenarios
when Amazon may either remove or strike-through feedback:

## Removal of feedback

Amazon will remove feedback if it determines doing so is necessary because of
the following cases:

  * The feedback includes words commonly understood to be obscene or profane. 
  * The feedback includes seller-specific, personally identifiable information, including email addresses, full names, or telephone numbers. 
  * The entire feedback comment is a product review. For example, “The Acme Super-Widget lacks the sharpness and speed of the Acme Ultra Widget.”

However, if the comment contains both a product review and feedback about your
service, we will not remove the feedback. For example, “Seller’s shipping
service was very slow, and the Acme Super-Widget lacks the sharpness and speed
of the Acme Ultra Widget.”

## Striking of feedback

Amazon may strike-through feedback in the following cases:

  * **The order was fulfilled by Amazon** : The entire comment relates explicitly to delivery experience for an order fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). In addition to the strike-through, the following statement will appear: This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience.
  * **The order was shipped using a "Claims Protected" Shipping Label** : See [Amazon Buy Shipping protections](/help/hub/reference/external/GB2FHL2QMQ5NT397) for more information

Refer to [Buyer Feedback for FBA listings](/gp/help/G201101660) for additional
information.

**Note:** If the feedback you have received meets the above criteria, you can
request for removal using [Feedback
Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/feedback-
manager/index.html?language=en_US&ref=ag_srfdback_cont_12051#/). The steps to
request for removal of feedback are outlined in [ Request removal of a
feedback](/gp/help/GSVLUKGSWX9EEM9N). You can address buyers’ issues by
replying to their feedback, using Feedback Manager. For further guidance on
replying to their feedback, refer to [Post a public
reply](/gp/help/GFX3VZKQVANVXRRB).

**Important:** You can request for feedback removal only via [Feedback
Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/feedback-
manager/index.html?language=en_US&ref=ag_srfdback_cont_12051#/). Contacting
our Support teams through ‘Contact Us’, or any other methods to request for
feedback removal, other than the Feedback Manager, may lead to account
deactivation. Removal requests must be made within 90 days of the feedback
submission. The system prevents feedback removal after 90 days.

tools are used to manage seller feedback](/gp/help/GRUKMKGABC9J3VLA)?
