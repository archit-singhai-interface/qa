Good images are important to your products' success. In an online store, the
product image is one of your most valuable marketing tools.

When customers browse Amazon pages, the image often draws them to consider
your product. With so many choices available for online purchases, a well-
formed image can set your product apart from the others. Poor quality images
turn away customers. Use your product images to communicate the selling points
and features of your products, to inform and interest customers, and to
reinforce your brand.

Every product must have a main image.

#### The following are required in product images:

Main images | 

  * Shot on a model (except for childrenswear, accessories, or transparent clothes) 
  * Pure white background (Hex #FFFFFF or RGB 255-255-255) 
  * Shows a frontal view of the product, preferably without any distracting accessories 
  * Shows the product completely, without any part clipped 
  * Minimum aspect ratio is close to 3:4 (width/height) and 85% of the total image area occupied

---|---  
Main and alternate images | 

  * High-resolution professional photos with 1600 pixels or larger in either height or width to activate the zoom feature. 
  * The color in the image must match the product for sale. 
  * When the product is transparent and shot on a model, genital parts, breasts, and buttocks must be covered. For this purpose, the model must be wearing clothes under the item.

  
  
#### The following are prohibited from product images:

Main images | 

  * Listings without main images or with placeholders (for example "no image available") 
  * Images on a background that is colored other than pure white
  * Sketches, drawing or graphical representations. Only photos are allowed. 
  * Borders, logos, watermarks, text, color blocks, inset images or other graphics. 
  * Multiple product views or multiple colorways/sizes, unless they are sold together as a multi-pack (which must be mentioned in the title). 
  * Product shown on a visible mannequin, hanger or holder
  * Folded products 
  * Product shown as a "selfie," in black and white only, or with the model lying down or kneeling 
  * Visible packaging, certificates, tags, or brochures 
  * Distracting accessories (for example, big earrings, bags, or sunglasses)

  
---|---  
Main and alternate images | 

  * Images that are blurry, pixelated, or with jagged edges. 
  * Children's wear images at a resolution less than 1600 pixels. 
  * Visible intimate human parts. Intimate parts covered by the model's hands, sheer products or graphics, visibly provocative genitalia contours, retouching of bare skin, and so on, are also prohibited. 
  * Images showing the model in a suggestive pose or with a suggestive face expression. Legs must not be spread, eyes must be open, mouth must be closed, arms should be along the body, and so on. 
  * Offensive or controversial content that promote hate, intolerance, violence, child exploitation, human tragedy, and so on.

  
  
## Types of images

Amazon displays several images for each product in the catalog. As a seller,
it is in your interest to provide several high-resolution product images for
your products so customers can make informed buying decisions. **You are
required to provide a main image for each parent and child SKU.** These are
the four types of images that illustrate your products:

  * The **parent SKU main image** , used for the product detail page (the page customers see when they search or browse the catalog). Only one main image is used per parent product. The main image appears as a smaller representation of the full-size image on the product detail page. When customers click the smaller picture, the full-size picture appears in a pop-up window. You must supply a parent main image.
  * The **child SKU main image** , used to show a view of the product in the specific color for the given child SKU. The main image for the child SKU shows in the image pop-up window. Each child SKU has just one main image, representing the child product in the specified color. You must supply a child main image for every color that you sell. 
  * **Alternate images** , used to show different views of the product to help clarify use, detail, fabric, cut, or other ways to view the product, or to show related products. You can supply up to eight alternate images for each parent or child SKU. The alternate image for a parent product appears in the image pop-up window. If a customer clicks a specific color in the image pop-up window (for example, a blue sample), then the pop-up window shows the alternate image for the "blue" SKU. 
  * When a customer clicks the swatch image, one of two things happens:
    * If the main image for the child product is available, then the swatch image or color name text on the detail page links to the image pop-up windows, and the main image for the child SKU appears in a pop-up window. 
    * If the main image for the child product is not available, then the swatch image or color name text on the detail page does not link to anything.

Even though you might not think of using swatch images, there are two ways you
can leverage swatch images for your products:

  * _Single image, many color variations_ : You might have several main images for all color variations for a product that does not have swatch images. You can use these images as swatch images and as main images for your variations. As with any swatch image, the images appear as thumbnails that, when clicked, appear full sized as the main image in a pop-up window.
  * _Single image, all product variations_ : You might have a single image featuring all color variations. For example, you might have a main image of a "pile of sweaters" to represent all the colors you sell, and you do not use swatch images. In this case, you can submit the "pile of sweaters" image as an alternative image. This alternative image is linked from the detail page, under the **See larger image or other views** link. All the alternative images appear in the same pop-up window. The customer can move from image to image by clicking the thumbnail in the pop-up window.

## Intimate clothing and swimwear

Images of intimate clothing, lingerie, and swimwear products must not be
sexually explicit or obscene, as determined at the sole discretion of Amazon.
In addition, images of such products must comply with the following rules:

  * **Exotic or erotic clothing (sexy lingerie)** : It is mandatory to set the “is_adult” flag during the creation of the listing.
  * Pasties or breast petals, when imaged, must be imaged off-model. 
  * Images of live models that use poses that could be interpreted as indecent, excessively erotic, or lewd are not permitted. 
  * Images that display full nudity (breasts, genitalia, bare bottoms, and so on) are not permitted. 
  * Images with live models wearing sheer products might be permitted, provided that genitalia and breasts or nipples are not exposed or presented in a lewd or provocative manner. No bars or other types of graphics are permitted to cover exposed body parts. 
  * Thongs and panties must use front views for the main product image. Back views can be uploaded as alternate views. 
  * Thongs and panties that do not provide full coverage in the front and back must have images that do not use a human model. Air-brushing is not permitted for exposed skin areas.
