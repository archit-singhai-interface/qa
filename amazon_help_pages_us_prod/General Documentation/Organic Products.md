**Important:** If you supply products for sale on Amazon, you must comply with
all federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to those
products and product listings.

In the United States, use of the term “organic” is regulated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). Any agricultural product that claims to be
“organic” or uses the USDA organic seal on its packaging must comply with the
USDA organic regulations.

To be sold, labeled, or represented as “organic” in the United States,
agricultural products --- whether raw or processed --- **must be certified**
to either the **USDA organic regulations** or **to an international standard
that the USDA has named as equivalent**. In either case, the products must:

  * Be produced according to the USDA organic requirements;
  * Comply with organic labeling requirements; and
  * Identify the name of the product’s [certifier](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/organic-certification/certifying-agents).

USDA’s organic regulations describe the specific standards required for you to
use the word “organic” or the USDA organic seal on food, feed, or fiber
products. For more information on the organic regulations and labeling
requirements, please see the following websites. Amazon provides these
resources for informational purposes only. We encourage you to consult with
legal counsel if you have questions about the laws and regulations concerning
your products.
