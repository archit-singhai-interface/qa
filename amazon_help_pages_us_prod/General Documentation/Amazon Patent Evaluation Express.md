Learn how Amazon Patent Evaluation Express (APEX) can help you report a
potential IP infringement.

The Amazon Patent Evaluation Express (APEX) program allows you to report
listings that may violate your intellectual property. With APEX, US utility
patent owners can report ASINs listed in our store that may infringe on their
patents.

**Note:** Participation in APEX is voluntary and confidential.

Rights owners or agents who have concerns about potential intellectual
property infringements of their utility patents can apply for the APEX program
using the Report a Violation tool. APEX allows US utility patent owners to
obtain a neutral evaluation of a patent infringement claim against ASINs
listed in our store.

If you apply for APEX and your patent meets the program requirements, the
reported sellers can opt in to the evaluation and defend their ASINs. If none
of the sellers opt in, or if the neutral evaluator finds that the reported
ASINs infringe on your patent, we’ll remove the reported ASINs from our store.

You can also use the APEX ID associated with this decision in future US
utility patent reports within the Report a Violation tool.

## Requirements for the program

Currently, APEX is only available to those who have a registered US utility
patent. APEX is not available outside of the United States. To participate in
the program, your patent must meet the following requirements:

  * It must be a registered US utility patent. Design patents, non-US patents, and expired patents are not eligible. 
  * There must not be a court order or International Trade Commission (ITC) order finding infringement of this patent. 

If there is litigation pending on a patent that is subject to a proposed or
pending evaluation, Amazon may decide not to initiate, or to suspend, an
evaluation until the completion of that litigation.

The following categories of claims and patents may not be eligible for APEX:

  * Extremely technical utility patents, such as patents that cover the operation of hardware components in consumer electronics 
  * Chemical composition claims 
  * Diagnostic claims 
  * Method claims where all steps of the method are not described on the product detail page 
  * Complex mechanical or electrical devices that require testing data or extensive breakdowns to demonstrate infringement 

## Apply for APEX

You can apply for the APEX program when you report a potential patent
infringement.

Applications can include up to 20 ASINs. If more than 20 ASINs are submitted
in a single application, Amazon may in its sole discretion reduce the patent
owner’s list to 20 ASINs.

To ensure that the evaluation is completed in a timely manner, we limit
applications to one claim from one unexpired US utility patent.

If you have a registered US utility patent, you can apply for the APEX program
by following these steps:  

  1. Sign in to Brand Registry, click **Protect** , and select **Report a violation**.
  2. Search and select one or more ASINs to report for potential patent infringement. 
  3. Select **Potential violation of my utility patent** and complete the questions that follow. 

**Note:** If you do not have a court order or an ITC order regarding the
enforcement of this patent, select “None of these” to learn about applying for
APEX.

  4. Provide the additional details that are requested in the form and select **Submit**.

Once your application has been submitted, a success message will appear.

## What to expect from the evaluation

When you submit an APEX application, we’ll contact each reported seller and
provide the opportunity to participate in the evaluation and defend their
listings against the patent infringement claim. If the seller does not
participate, we will automatically remove their listings from our store.

If a seller chooses to participate, we will engage a neutral evaluator, who is
an attorney skilled in patent analysis. The evaluator will review the patent
infringement claim against the third-party product listing in our store.

We’ll use email to communicate with each party in the evaluation (for example,
sellers, evaluators, rights owners and agents).

The initial APEX evaluation typically takes 4 to 6 weeks to complete. If a
seller chooses to participate, the evaluation can take an additional 8 weeks
to complete (12 to 14 weeks total). During this time, the reported listing
will remain live.

The evaluator will determine the outcome of the evaluation and may decide that
the patent does not cover a product listing because:

  * It does not infringe; 
  * A court has found the patent invalid or unenforceable; 
  * The accused products (or physically identical products) were on sale more than one year before the earliest effective filing date of the patent. 

Amazon will comply with the evaluator’s decision pending any litigation or
settlement between the patent owner and sellers, or other legal proceedings
that may impact the patent. If the evaluator rules in favor of the patent
owner, then the listing will be removed from our store.

## Evaluator’s fee

The evaluator requires a $4,000 deposit from all parties that are
participating in the evaluation. Amazon does not handle the deposit and does
not retain any portion of this fee.

The outcome of the evaluation determines the party that ultimately pays this
fee.

| **APEX evaluation outcome** | **Evaluator’s fee** | **Paid by** | **Description**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 | No sellers opt in | No fee | Not applicable | If no sellers opt in to an evaluation, the patent owner will not be required to make a $4,000 deposit.  
2 | Evaluated in the patent owner's favor | $4,000 | Seller | The evaluator’s $4,000 fee will be paid by the seller if the evaluation is in the rights owner's favor and the rights owner, the winning participant, will receive their $4,000 deposit back.  
3 | Evaluated in the seller's favor | $4,000 | Patent owner | The evaluator’s $4,000 fee will be paid by the rights owner or agent if the evaluation is in the seller's favor and the seller, the winning participant, will receive their $4,000 deposit back.  
  
## Check the status of an APEX application

Once you’ve submitted an APEX application, you can track its status by
following the steps below:  

  1. Click **Monitor** and select **Submission history**. 
  2. Scroll down the page and click the **APEX application** filter under **Submission channel**. 
  3. Click **Open details** next to the complaint ID to view the status of your application. 

**APEX application status** | **Definition**  
---|---  
Application received | The application has been submitted.   
APEX ID granted | Either none of the reported sellers opted into the evaluation, or the evaluator determined that some or all of the reported listings infringe on the patent.  
APEX ID not granted | Either the application did not meet the criteria for an APEX ID, or the evaluator determined that none of the reported listings infringe on the patent.  
Application rejected | The patent is not eligible for APEX.  
  
## Report a violation with my APEX ID

If we grant your application an APEX ID, you can use this APEX ID when
submitting a report of potential utility patent infringement in the future.
This helps to ensure that we can remove infringing ASINs.

To report a violation using an APEX ID, follow these steps:  

  1. Sign in to Brand Registry, click **Protect** , and select **Report a violation**.
  2. Indicate that you have an APEX ID. 
  3. Enter the APEX ID in the text field. 

If you include an APEX ID with your report, we’ll use the information from the
neutral patent evaluation when reviewing the potential infringement.
