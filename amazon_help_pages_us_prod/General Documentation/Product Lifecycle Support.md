The mission of Product Lifecycle Support (PLS) is to offer relevant post-
purchase product support to customers and empower them to make the most of the
products purchased on Amazon. By solving post-purchase product issues, we
prevent avoidable returns which helps the planet by extending products life
and helps brands reduce the financial and environmental impact of returns.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Will I experience an increase in call volume when I enroll my brand into
the PLS manufacturer support program?

Yes. We cannot provide exact numbers on the increase in received by the
manufacturer, but based on the brand information, it can be assumed that
customer contacts may increase by approximately 5 to 8%. Note that it is not 5
to 8% of total sales but 5 to 8% of existing contact volumes.

Additionally, the contact volumes will fluctuate based on the number of items
the brand sells in any given month. While contact volumes may increase after
enrolling into **product lifecycle support’s manufacturer support program** ,
it gives brands an opportunity to prevent returns by addressing post-purchase
issues which in turn not only helps customers keep and use their products, but
also increases brand loyalty.
