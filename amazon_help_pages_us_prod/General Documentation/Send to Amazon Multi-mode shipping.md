Step 2 of Send to Amazon, [Confirm shipping](/gp/help/GWC4BVUFCZ2FKHQW), lets
you choose your shipping mode for small parcel and pallet shipments. The
shipping mode refers to how your shipment will be transported.

You can choose either a single shipping mode and carrier across the entire
workflow, or choose different modes per shipment within a workflow.

## Select multiple shipping modes

To send both [small parcel](/gp/help/200280260) and
[pallet](/gp/help/200280270) shipments to Amazon in the same workflow, follow
these steps:

  1. In the **Confirm shipping** step, enter the estimated **Ship date** for the shipments. When you provide the expected date for carrier pickup, we can plan for the arrival of your inventory and avoid unnecessary delays. 

  2. Unselect **Shipping mode will be the same for all shipments**.

  3. For each shipment, select either **Small parcel delivery** or **Less than truckload** under **Shipping mode**. 

  4. For small parcel shipments, select a carrier. The same carrier must be used for all small parcel shipments in a workflow.

  5. Review the shipments that are assigned and any applicable estimated charges for shipping, prep, and labeling. Click **Accept charges and confirm shipping** if everything looks right.

Continue to step 3, [Print box labels](/gp/help/GCUH6KKZA6PRA4E7), where
youâ€™ll print your box labels and any applicable partnered carrier labels for
your shipments.

**Note:** A single workflow cannot include both [partnered
carriers](/gp/help/201119120) and non-partnered carriers for your shipments.
