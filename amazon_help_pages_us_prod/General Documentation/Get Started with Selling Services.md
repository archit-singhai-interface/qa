## Account Setup

Before you can create your first offer, you need to complete your account
setup. Go to the **Settings** menu and select **Service Provider**. On that
page, review the following information:

  * Background Checks: Review the status of technician background checks.
  * Service Locations: Enter information about when and where you do business.
  * Resource Management: Add, edit, or remove service technicians. See [Your Business Information](/gp/help/201484970) for more information about background checks.
  * Licenses: Your business must have the appropriate licenses and permits to perform the services you offer on Amazon. 
  * Insurance Information: Manage your insurance details. All service providers are required to carry certain insurance coverage limits, and to register the up-to-date insurance information in their Seller Central Account. For more information about insurance requirements, see [Selling Services Terms](/gp/help/201484410).

On the Settings menu, also review and complete the following information:

  * Account Info: Review your Seller Information, Business Address, and Deposit and Charge Methods. You must have a valid checking account and credit card on record in your service provider account. Without these two items, you cannot be paid. For more information, see [How Amazon Transfers Payments](/gp/help/19321). 
  * Notification Preferences: Select which notification types you want to enable. Also verify your emergency contact information in the Other Notifications section.
  * Login Settings: Use this feature to manage your account login name and password.

After you complete set up, take some time to familiarize yourself with the
following services that are available to you through your service provider
account:

  * [Buyer-Seller Messaging Service](/gp/help/200389080).
  * Reports: [Payments](/gp/help/60511) and [Business](/gp/help/200633570) reports.
