In the **Add a Product** tool, choosing the best category ensures that you see
the most appropriate data fields for your product. Find your productâ€™s best
category using the **Find your products in Amazon's catalog** search box or
browse the categories directly, by clicking the links, to choose one on your
own.

## How do I identify my product's category?

If you are not sure of your product's category, the search tool is a quick and
useful option. In the box, type a few simple product keywords. It is often
best to choose the most basic keywords from the product's name, such as
"baseball glove" or "evening gown."

The results page suggests a list of categories on the right, and on the left
side, displays a list of high-level categories with similar products. You can
refine and restrict your search within a single category. You can browse
several subcategories before you reach the most specific level. When you reach
this point and have selected the best category for your product, you will
continue on to enter and submit your product information to create a product
detail page.
