**IMPORTANT** : Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

Package plush Units, such as stuffed toys, animals, and puppets, so they will
not be damaged during receipt, stocking, shipment preparation, or shipment to
the customer. Units must be placed in a sealed poly bag or shrink-wrapped.
