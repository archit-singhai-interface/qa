## Request exemptions in bulk

To request exemptions in bulk, follow these steps:

  1. Identify whether your SKUs fall under one of the categories listed on [Prepaid returns for seller-fulfilled orders](/gp/help/202072200) under “Category exemptions.”

  2. Download the **Prepaid label exemption template**.   

    1. Follow the steps in the **Instructions** tab to prepare your template.
    2. Indicate the exemption reason code for the SKUs. 
    3. Once you’ve completed the **Prepaid exemptions** tab, make sure that no Excel filters are applied, and then save the template as an Excel workbook file in an accessible location on your computer. This will allow you to make changes after you upload the template.
    4. Save the template as a tab delimited (*.txt) file in order to upload it. Make sure that the **Prepaid exemptions** tab is displayed when you save the file.

**Note:** The exemption request won’t go through properly if you save and
upload any other tab.

  3. Go to your [Return settings](/gp/returns/settings/ref=id_xx_cont_202072200) and click **Manage return templates**.

  4. Under **Upload file,** select the correct store and upload your **Prepaid exemptions** tab delimited (*.txt) file that you saved before.

**Note:** While your exemption request is pending validation, the SKUs will be
set to their default returns. If the exemption is approved, the SKUs will be
exempted from prepaid returns policies. If the exemption is rejected, the SKUs
will be subject to prepaid return policies.

## Exemption request status

out.
