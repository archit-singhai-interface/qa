This page applies to items lost or damaged on your FBA customer order. Amazon
must already have refunded or replaced the items on behalf of your seller
account. For information about how Amazon processes refunds, replacements, and
returns, see the [FBA customer returns policy](/gp/help/200379860).

The process to file a claim varies based on where in the fulfillment process
your item is lost or damaged:

## Claim window

You can file a customer return claim no sooner than 60 days and no later than
120 days after the customer refund or replacement.

**Note:**

Sometimes a customer is refunded for your item, but the item isn’t returned to
a fulfillment center within 60 days of the refund. When this situation occurs,
in most cases we’ll charge the customer and reimburse you.

If a customer returns your item to a fulfillment center within 60 days of the
refund, we’ll first determine the condition of the returned item. If the
returned item is sellable, we’ll return the item to your inventory and will
not reimburse you.

If the returned item is unsellable, we’ll determine who is responsible for the
condition. If we find Amazon is responsible for an unsellable return, we’ll
reimburse you and will not add the item back to your inventory.

**Important:**

  * Amazon does not accept responsibility and will not reimburse you for returned items that are damaged by a customer, are subject to recall, are defective or in violation of Amazon policies, or for other similar reasons. Items that fall into these categories are added to your unfulfillable inventory when they are returned.
  * Per [our returns policy](/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201819190), there are no reimbursements for refunded items that cannot be returned by customers, unless it is for a reason for which we take responsibility.
  * Amazon won’t reimburse you for any refund that you issue directly to a customer.

Eligibility window start date  | Eligibility claim window | Eligibility window end date

60 days from the customer refund date  | 60 days | 120 days from the customer refund date  
  
## Before you submit a claim

  * Check your [Manage FBA Returns report](/fba-return) to see if Amazon refunded or replaced the item on your FBA order.
  * Check your [FBA customer returns report](/reportcentral/CUSTOMER_RETURNS/0) to see if the refunded or replaced item was returned to your inventory.
  * Check your [Reimbursements report](/reportcentral/REIMBURSEMENTS/0) to see if you have already been reimbursed for the lost or damaged item. To filter the results, search by the Amazon order ID.

## Submit your claim

After reviewing and reconciling the reports above, if you still believe a lost
or damaged item is eligible for a reimbursement, you can file a claim.

Enter the customer order ID in the following tool to check your eligibility
and file a claim. We may ask you to provide additional details about the item.
