Using a combination of Amazon business customer demand signals, including
search data, quotes requests, and customer-submitted product listings, we have
compiled a list of products that are in demand, but are not yet on Amazon
store.

The report is refreshed weekly and includes the following data for each
product recommendation:

#### Product

The title of each product.

#### Brand

The brand name of the product.

#### B2B Opportunity

Represents the position of ASIN in terms of demand from Amazon Business
customers versus other products in the same product type. Certain badges may
also show in this column if it has special demand from Amazon Business
customers.

#### Category

The primary product category (For example, Office Products).

#### Manufacturer Part Number

The Manufacturer Part Number, or MPN, of each product.

#### European Article Number

The European Article Number, or EAN, of each product.

#### Model Number

The model number of each product.
