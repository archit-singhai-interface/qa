Trademark contact information |  Our investigation team uses both publicly available information as well as internal resources to verify trade mark contact information.  In this case, we could not locate any contact information that meets our requirements. Although we cannot guarantee enrollment in Brand Registry, we encourage applicants to check the following details:   

  1. All business information is kept consistent and up to date everywhere their business information is registered. 
  2. If there is an attorney or representative associated with the brand, make sure this information is displayed on the trade mark website with the registered trade mark information whenever possible. 
  3. If there is an email address associated with the trade mark, make sure it is a valid email address.

**Note:** This doesn't mean that your registered trade mark must display an email address. We're aware that some organizations don't display contact information of Rights Owners for privacy reasons. After you ensure the information above is accurate and updated, reapply for Brand Registry. | Ensure that all information in your trademark record is updated and then reapply.
