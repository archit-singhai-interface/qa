**Important:** If you supply products for sale on Amazon, you must comply with
all federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to those
products and product listings.

You must comply with all applicable federal laws, including disclosure
requirements, when selling upholstered furniture, bedding, and mattress
products. You must also comply with state and local laws applicable to the
jurisdiction into which your products are sold. For example, many state laws
have requirements governing the content labeling of such products. These
labeling laws vary by state and may specify requirements for (among other
things):

  * Minimum label and font size.
  * Proper description of filler materials, including the percentage by weight of each, listed in order of predominance.
  * Additional information as may be required, such as a Uniform Registry Number (URN) or sterilization permit number. 

In addition, you are responsible for obtaining any required licenses and
permits applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, importers, and distributors
of furniture, bedding, and mattress products and are liable for any penalties
resulting from non-compliance.
