by offsetting any amounts payable by you against any amounts otherwise payable
by us to you). Also, we may seek payment or reimbursement of fees by any other
means permitted by your Selling partner agreement or applicable law. We
reserve the right to adjust charges after they are initially posted to reflect
adjustments by the applicable carrier or other service provider. We may limit
or disallow services in our discretion.

**Compliance with laws**. You will comply with all applicable policies, laws,
and regulations with respect to delivery and related third-party services you
buy.

**Third-Party Service Terms apply**. Your purchase and use of delivery and
