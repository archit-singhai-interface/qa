Amazon Pay provides payment solutions that let people use the payment
instruments that are stored in their Amazon accounts to pay for goods and
services on third-party websites and on applications that accept Amazon Pay.
Amazon Pay is used by both businesses and customers.

  * **Businesses** , including non-profits, add the Amazon Pay button on the checkout or cart pages of their websites so that customers can sign in and access their Amazon account-related payment instruments. Each business can personalize the customerâ€™s shopping experience using the customer name and email. Amazon Pay is easy, secure, and trusted and offers a familiar buying experience.
  * **Customers** click the Amazon Pay button on business websites to access the payment instruments and addresses in their Amazon accounts and then pay for products. If a customer already has an Amazon account, they sign in and accept the customer agreement. If a customer doesn't have an Amazon account, they quickly create one in about 20 seconds. Customers can also use Alexa to pay by voice. Purchases are protected by the Amazon A-to-z Guarantee. Customers pay no additional fees. Beyond the button, shoppers can manage their payments using Amazon Pay on Amazon.com, and it's also an easy way for you to integrate Alexa* into the shopping experience.  
  

*Availability may vary based on Alexa Skills integration.

**Note:**  Businesses that use third-party ecommerce platforms (like Shopify
and Magento) can integrate Amazon Pay. Amazon Pay supports businesses that use
their own in-house technical teams for custom integrations.
