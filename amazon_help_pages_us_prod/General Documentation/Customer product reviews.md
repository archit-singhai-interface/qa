_Watch the video above for an introduction to Amazonâ€™s customer product review
policies._

Amazon encourages buyers to review the products they like and dislike to help
customers make informed decisions about the products they purchase.

To ensure that reviews remain helpful, sellers must comply with [Customer
product reviews policies](/gp/help/YRKB5RU3FS5TURN).

For answers to common questions about customer product reviews, see [Answers
to questions about product reviews](/gp/help/201972160).

**Note:** As sellers and manufacturers, you are not allowed to review your own
products, or to negatively review a competitor's product. Violation of our
policies may also violate applicable laws, which can lead to legal action and
civil and criminal penalties. If you violate our policies, Amazon reserves the
right to disclose your name and other related information publicly and to
civil or criminal enforcement authorities. For additional examples, refer to
[Inappropriate product reviews](/gp/help/GE8SYAZUBGVFBHCH).

## Report abuse

**Note:** Refer to [Customer product reviews
policies](/gp/help/YRKB5RU3FS5TURN) before reporting abuse.

To report possible violations of our policies, send email to community-
help@amazon.com, specifying the location of the content and the reason you
believe it violates the guidelines.
