When customers outside your country purchase your products on Amazon, one way
to fulfill these orders is to ship them yourself internationally. There are
several things to consider when shipping internationally direct to your
customers.

##  Sending your products internationally direct to your customers

If your inventory is located in a different country than the marketplace where
your customers placed their order, you need to ship the product
internationally to your customer. Here is an overview of the process:  

  1. The seller chooses a carrier that can ship internationally.
  2. The seller ships the product and is the exporter of record. 

**Important:** Do not expose customers to customs delays and additional duties
and taxes on their products. It is your responsibility to take care of such
matters when you ship the product.

  3. The carrier acts as the broker by default, according to the terms and conditions on the freight bill. The carrier will collect duties from the buyer upon delivery of the products.

It is also important to manage customer expectations. You should provide
customers with accurate information about the country from which you are
shipping your product. Specifically, you need to accurately state the
"shipping from" country in your seller profile and manage customer
expectations by stating the actual shipping times from your country. You will
be responsible to meet the shipping expectations for all orders you receive.

##  International shipping costs

International shipping charges vary depending on several factors, including:

  * Package dimensions and weight
  * Delivery time
  * Source (where you are shipping from) and destination (where you are shipping to). Costs can be considerably higher for international destinations.

In addition to the above charges, you should be aware of [customs duties and
taxes](/gp/help/201468380) that will need to be paid. Do not expose customers
to customs delays and additional duties and taxes on their products. It is
your responsibility to take care of such matters when you ship the product.

##  International shipping times

Fulfilling an order internationally will take more time than doing so
domestically. Shipping times are reflected in the offer detail page and may
make your offer less competitive relative to domestic counterparts.

##  Other resources

There are also many online resources that can help sellers determine rates and
that will make shipping easier. Here are a few links, organized by region,
