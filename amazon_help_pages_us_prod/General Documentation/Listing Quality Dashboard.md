The [Listing Quality Dashboard](/quality) is a tool on Seller Central that
highlights important product information for customers. These recommendations
are focused on helping you improve the discoverability of your products,
enabling better customer experiences like product overview or tabular spec
view, and helping to reduce returns on your products.

#### What are the benefits of the Listing Quality Dashboard?

The dashboard shows you product listings that need improvement and provides
recommendations on which product attributes to add. By adding the recommended
information for your products, you can:

  * **Help improve discovery:** Customers filter their search results using specific attributes. Adding these attributes will ensure that customers don’t miss your product when it meets the customer requirements and when the filters are used.

  * **Enable the product overview experience:** Product overview will highlight important product attributes above the bullet points on the product detail page. This will help customers evaluate your product easily and make a faster buying decision. This experience is currently available for a limited number of product types and we are working to enable this for more product types.

  * **Tabular spec view in search:** The tabular spec view enables customers to read through the top product specifications for ASINs in search results, evaluate key differences between products, and help make purchase decisions quickly by surfacing key product details on the ASIN faceout in a tabular format.

  * **Compare products through the product comparison feature in search:** This experience helps customers compare product specifications at a glance.
  * **Price per unit attribute:** Price per unit helps customers compare prices across different pack sizes.

  * **Potentially reduce customer returns:** Customers often return products due to a lack of critical product information on the product detail page (for example, compatibility features for headphones and cables). By adding more information, you might reduce the number of returns.
  * **Take time-sensitive actions** : The tool will highlight listing information that needs to be filled in by a certain date in order to prevent possible suppression.

#### Listing Quality Dashboard best practices

  * Check your recommendations at least once a week. Our systems identify important missing product attributes on a real-time basis, so frequent check-ins (daily or weekly) are highly recommended.
  * Use **Sales** , **Available to sell** and **Page Views** to prioritize your recommendations.
  * Use the **Attribute not applicable for product** option when needed. We understand that there can be some instances where the attribute we recommend you to fill is not relevant for the product. In such cases, select the **Attribute not applicable for product** option and let us know the reason, to improve our recommendations.

## Frequently asked questions

On the Listing Quality Dashboard, under the **Recommendations** section, click
View all improvements. When prompt with a pop-up screen, click the **Improve
search results** tab to add the keywords.

#### Why is my ASIN data not being updated on the catalog even after
submitting the information on the Listing Quality Dashboard?

It takes up to 48 hours for the listing to be updated. In some cases, the
value may not be accepted because there may be errors or restrictions on the

not apply to my ASINs?

clear** , or **Attribute value not in the dropdown**. After you submit a
reason code, the attribute will not appear for your listing again.
