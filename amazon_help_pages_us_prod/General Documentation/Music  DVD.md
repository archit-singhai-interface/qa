As part of our ongoing efforts to provide a great shopping experience, we are
implementing selling qualifications for some products in the Music and DVD
categories that might have a higher risk of authenticity issues. Some products
in the Music and DVD categories are restricted, while others require an
application to sell.

**Note:** The DVD category includes Blu-ray and 4K formats.

To determine whether you are qualified to sell a product in the Music or DVD
category, you can check the individual listing information through your Seller
Central account by following these steps:  

  1. In Seller Central, click the **Inventory** drop-down menu and select **Add a Product**.
  2. Search for the product you want to sell.
  3. In the search results, click the link **Listing limitations apply** to the right of the product.
  4. If the **Request Approval** button appears, click the button to begin the application process. If the Request Approval button does not appear, we are not accepting applications to sell this product at this time.

##  Application requirements

The Request Approval link will include the application requirements and
instructions on how to provide the requested information.

General application requirements include the following:  

  1. Your primary source(s) of inventory
  2. An estimate of the quantity of units you plan to sell
  3. A minimum of 1 invoice from your largest inventory source that is representative of the types of products you plan to sell

Your application will be evaluated based on the information you provide.
Submitted invoices will be verified. Please note that we do **not** accept
pro-forma invoices (sent in advance of the purchase or delivery of goods).

**Important:** Providing fabricated documents will result in the removal of
your Amazon selling privileges.
