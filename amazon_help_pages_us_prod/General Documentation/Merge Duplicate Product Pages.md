Duplicate product pages in the Amazon catalog are confusing to customers and
can make product search and purchasing decisions difficult.

You can merge product pages in your inventory if they represent the same
physical product. If you find identical product pages you can request to merge
them using the **Merge duplicate product detail pages** self-service tool:

**Note:** ASINs for brands registered in Amazon Brand Registry can only be
merged if the requester is the rights owner. To learn more about being a
rights owner, see the [Amazon Brand
Registry](https://brandservices.amazon.com/) page.
