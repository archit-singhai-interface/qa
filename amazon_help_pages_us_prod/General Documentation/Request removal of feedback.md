Refer to the criteria outlined in [Can Amazon remove buyer
feedback](/gp/help/G20231) before requesting removal of feedback via Feedback
Manager.

**Important:** Requests for feedback removal can only be made via Feedback
Manager, and usage of any other channel to request the same may potentially
result in the deactivation of your selling account. Removal requests must be
made within 90 days of the feedback submission. The system will prevent
feedback removals after 90 days.

If you are concerned about incorrect feedback that meets our criteria, you can
request for removal of the feedback by following the steps outlined below:  

  1. Go to the [Feedback Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/feedback-manager/index.html#/). 
  2. In the **Recent Feedback** table, next to the specific **Order ID** , select **Request removal** under the **Actions** column.
