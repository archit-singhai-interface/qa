Prime Exclusive Discount is a price discount that is available to Prime
members. Product offers with a Prime Exclusive Discount will show a discounted
price with the regular price crossed out. Buyers will also see a savings
summary in search results and on product detail pages. Prices adjusted for
discounts are displayed on the Featured Offer detail page.

Before you start the discount creation process, download the discount upload
template spreadsheet from the [Prime Exclusive Discounts](/prime-discounts)
page. You can create Prime Exclusive Discounts from this page, following below
steps:  

  1. Click **Create discount** , enter the name of the discount, and choose the start and end dates. 
     * In case of Prime Day discounts, the date fields will not be available, and your scheduled Prime Day discounts will start at the beginning of Prime Day.
     * Click **Save and Add Products**.
  2. Upload the completed Discount Upload spreadsheet.
     * Refer to the **Data Definition** worksheet in the template for proper format. The system might generate errors if you don’t follow the format. For some of the common reasons for upload errors, go to [Fix a file type error for Prime Exclusive Discount SKUs](/gp/help/GMJK2KBX3J2XNBQD).
     * Once you upload your file, click **Validate Products** to check whether [SKUs are eligible](/gp/help/GNC7446W4QUUSXEU) for Prime Exclusive Discount. You will be directed to the **Review** page.
  3. On the **Review** page, you can see whether a product is ready to submit or whether it is invalid (that is, failed validation).
     * You will also receive an email with the validation status of each of the products that you uploaded.
     * Click **Submit** to schedule the discount.
     * In case you still have some invalid SKUs in review, you can always return to the **Review** page even after submitting the discount to delete them from the discount.

**Note:** Product and offer eligibility will be validated during submission as
well as periodically after submission. If your discount doesn’t satisfy the
eligibility criteria, then your Prime Exclusive Discount for the affected SKU
will be suppressed. You can always [edit](/gp/help/GYPA73ZU4JXU4NX7) the
discount information of the product and republish.
