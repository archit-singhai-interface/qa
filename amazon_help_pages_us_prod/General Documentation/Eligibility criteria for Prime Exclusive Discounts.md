Prime Exclusive Discounts can be offered on both Prime (FBA and Seller
Fulfilled Prime) and non-Prime (seller-fulfilled) offers.  Your Prime
Exclusive Discount must meet all of these criteria:

  * The product must be in new condition.
  * The product must have a rating of at least 3 stars, or no rating. This requirement may change for discounts that are specific to special events such as Prime Day and Black Friday.
  * The discount must be at least 10% off the non-member, non-promotional price (that is, your price or sale price, whichever is lower). This requirement may change for discounts that are specific to special events such as Prime Day and Black Friday.
  * The item is not a restricted product, nor is it offensive, embarrassing, or inappropriate.
  * The Prime Exclusive Discounted price must beat the lowest price for the ASIN in the past 30 days. The lowest price in the last 30 days is the lowest customer bought price for the ASIN in that period including all deals, promotional, and sale prices across all sellers.
  * The product must comply with our customer product reviews policies. For more information, go to [Customer product reviews policies](/gp/help/GYRKB5RU3FS5TURN).
