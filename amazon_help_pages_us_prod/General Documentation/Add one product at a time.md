**Add Products** is an interactive web-based interface that’s used to list a
small number of products, one at a time. This tool is available within the
**Catalog** drop-down menu of your seller account. The Add Products tool can
be used for the following:

  * **Match to an existing product listing:** If you have a product that you want to sell that already exists on Amazon, you must match it to the existing product detail page.
  * **Create a new product listing:** If the product that you want to sell does not exist on Amazon, you can list a new product and Amazon will create a new product detail page.
  * **Copy an existing listing:** : If you have products that are similar in nature (for example, two different bottles manufactured by the same brand with the same material), you can create the first listing and then use the Copy Listing feature. The feature lets you quickly copy product information from the first listing in your inventory and make only the required changes to the second listing.

**Note:** If you have a Professional selling plan, and prefer to work with
your product listings offline, we recommend using an [inventory
template](/gp/help/G201576410).

## Match to an existing product listing

**Note:** This option is not available to Amazon Handmade sellers.

Before matching your product to the existing product listing on Amazon, ensure
that you have the following information available:

Information to provide | Description  
---|---  
Offer details | Offer includes the product's condition, price, quantity, and shipping options. You can update your offer information at any time.  
Follow these steps to match to an existing product listing:  

  1. From the **Catalog** drop-down menu, select [Add Products](/productsearch/ref=xx_addlisting_dnav_xx).
  2. Search for the product that you want to sell.

**Note:** Results are more accurate if you search for a product identifier,
such as a UPC, EAN, JAN, or an ISBN.

  3. If you locate the product that you want to sell, follow these steps:  

    1. Select a condition.
    2. Click **Sell this product**.
    3. Enter your offer details in the provided fields.

**Note:** Required fields are marked with an asterisk. To learn more about a
field, hover over the question mark next to the field.

    4. Click **Save and finish**.

You can also search for up to 20 product IDs at the same time by selecting the
**Search multiple products** option in the initial search box.

## Create a new product listing

If you're unable to locate your product using **Add Products** , you can
[create a new product listing](/hz/productclassify) on Amazon. Before creating
a new listing on Amazon, ensure that you have the following information
available:

Information to provide | Description  
---|---  
Product identifier | Most products have a unique identification code, such as a UPC, EAN, JAN, or ISBN, which ensure accurate information on the product detail page. If you have a UPC, EAN, or GTIN, select the **UPC** , **EAN** , or**GTIN** option from the **External product ID** drop-down menu in your listing form.   
Offer details | Offer details include the product’s condition, price, quantity, and shipping options. You can update your offer information at any time.  
Product details | Product details include the product name (title), brand, category, description, and images. These details help customers to better understand your product and make informed buying decisions. Required attributes may vary depending on the category in which you’re listing your products.  
Keywords and search terms | Strong keywords can help make your products easier for buyers to find. To learn more, see [Use search terms effectively](/gp/help/G23501).  
  
Follow these steps to create a new product listing on Amazon:

  1. Select [Add Products](/productsearch/ref=xx_addlisting_dnav_xx) from the **Catalog** drop-down.

  2. Click **I’m adding a product not sold on Amazon**.

  3. In the **Item name** box, enter the most fitting title for your product. Amazon will suggest a product type based on your title that you enter.

  4. Click **Confirm** , and the form will load according to your product type selection. If Amazon doesn't provide product type recommendations based on your title, follow these steps:    

    1. Click **Select other** to open the category selector window.
    2. Under **Select a category** , find the category matching your product, and click **Select**. Accurately choosing your category helps buyers in easily discovering your products.

**Note:** You can mark your frequently used categories as favorites by
clicking the star icon next to each category. These categories will then
appear under **Favorites** at the top of the Select a product type window.

  5. Enter the required information in the **Product identity, Description, Product details, Offer and Safety & compliance** tabs.

**Note:** You can opt to view either required attributes or all attributes by
using the attributes filter option on the left panel.

  6. Once you enter the required information in the tabs provided, click **Submit** to complete the listing process. You can edit product information for listings anytime by using the Manage All Inventory tool.

**Note:**

     * Detail pages are shared with other sellers who can offer the same product. Amazon chooses what information to include on the product detail page based on manufacturer and seller contributions. To learn more, go to [Product detail pages and offers](/gp/help/G51).
     * Amazon displays listings with relevant and accurate information on the detail page. It is highly recommended that you provide appropriate information for your product listings, to help buyers make a well-informed purchase. Review the following help guides for best practices while listing a product:
       * [Amazon Services Quick Start Style Guide](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/help/Selling_on_Amazon_Quick_Start_Style_Guide_2018.pdf)
       * [Product image requirements](/gp/help/G1881)
       * [Product Listing Guidelines](/gp/help/G202073140)

The information that you provide will be published on Amazon typically within
15 minutes and your product will be visible to customers through search and
browse.

After you add new products or listings, confirm if you can find your products
by searching or browsing for them. If you cannot find your products, go to
[Use search terms effectively](/gp/help/G23501) and [How do I find my products
on the Amazon website](/gp/help/G21251)

.

## Copy a listing

The **Copy Listing** feature allows you to create a new product detail page by
using information from an existing listing.

You can copy a listing in two ways:

  * **From Amazon’s catalog:** From the **Catalog** drop-down menu, select **Add Products** , and search for the existing listing that you want to copy the product information from. In the drop-down menu to the right of the listing, select **Copy and list**.
  * **From your existing catalog:** From the **Inventory** drop-down menu, select **Manage All Inventory**. In the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the product, select **Copy listing**.

Alternatively, you can search for existing listings by using the **Copy from**
option in the left panel of the **Add Products** tool. Once the information is
copied to a new listing, make the necessary changes to the listing and click
**Save and finish**.

For more information, go to [Copy a listing](/gp/help/GJAQ5MM8LB7MMZB7).

## Generate listing content

When you create a new product listing, you can use the latest in generative
artificial intelligence (AI) to populate details of your listing with the
Generate Listing Content feature.

If available, **Generate listing content** will appear at the top of the first
tab when you start creating a new listing. Simply provide a brief description
or a list of keywords that best describe your product, and a full-length form
with product details will be generated for your review.

There is no minimum input length, but longer and more descriptive entries will
lead to better quality output.

**Note:** Please review generated content thoroughly and ensure it is accurate
and complies with all [Intellectual Property and Listing
policies](/gp/help/G521). AI-generated content can include features and claims
that weren't in your original input.

## Save product details for future listings

With Listing Preferences, you can save product details to streamline your
future listings. When creating a new product listing, check the **Save product
details for future listings** option before submitting. Once the listing is
successfully submitted, these details will be saved in a new preference
profile.

Next time you create your listing within the same Product Type, just select
your saved **Listing Preference** to automatically fill in your product
details.

You can also customize the name and attributes assigned to your preference
profile:

  * **Creating a new preference** : Click the **product attributes** link to open a panel where you can set your preferred details.
  * **Updating an existing preference** : Click **Edit** to open the same panel and make updates as needed.

**Note:** You can visit the [Listing Preferences Dashboard](/listing-
preferences?tab=preference-profiles) to view, update or delete your preference
profiles at any time.

## Listing in multiple stores

Whether you are matching to an existing product listing or creating a new one,
you have the option to make your listing available across multiple Amazon
stores during the listing process. To do so, provide additional attributes in
the **Offer** tab, such as the price for each additional store that you want
to create listings in, in addition to the store that you have selected in the
Seller Central header.

Prices should be provided in the local store currency, which is denoted in the
price field. If a detail page doesn’t exist yet in those stores, Amazon will
attempt to automatically translate and create a page on your behalf. This
process can take up to 48 hours to complete, and you will be able to suggest
content changes in the local language after completion.

Available stores are determined by where you are registered, and for stores
outside of regions like Europe or North America, by your linked accounts. To
find out more about listing policies for each store, go to Amazon’s [Category,
product, and listing restrictions](/gp/help/G200301050).
