**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

Pellets, powders, and granular products are dry goods that are pourable and
can cause damage during shipping and when stored. Package these products
securely to protect Amazon associates, other products, and customers. Be sure
to adhere to the guidelines for [glass containers](/gp/help/200280160) if the
product is packaged in glass. Sets, kits, or bundled products containing
pellets, powders or granular material must meet these requirements as well.

All products that contain pellets, powders, or granular substances must be
able to withstand a 3-foot (91.4 cm) drop test without the contents of the
container leaking or spilling.

  * Products that cannot withstand the drop test must be packaged in poly bags.
  * For more information, review the [requirements for poly bags](/gp/help/200141500).

A drop test consists of five 3-foot (91.4 cm) drops onto a hard surface
without breaking or leaking:

  * Flat on base
  * Flat on top
  * Flat on longest side
  * Flat on shortest side
  * On a corner

**Not Permitted:** The powder has an unsecured lid that could open spilling
the contents.

**Permitted:** The powder is in a sealed bag with suffocation warning label.

A good example of a well-sealed granular product that passes the Vigorous
Shaking (VS) test:
