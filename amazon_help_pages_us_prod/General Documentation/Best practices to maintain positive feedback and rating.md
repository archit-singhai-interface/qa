This table outlines the best practices for identifying and resolving potential
problems, which may lead to positive ratings.

Problem | Possible Causes | Solutions  
---|---|---  
Stock-out | Inventory is not available | 

  * Do not list backordered items.
  * Maintain a minimum threshold of inventory.
  * Remove offerings that are consistently out-of-stock.

  
Inventory quantity is not accurate | 

  * Send inventory update feeds as frequently as orders arrive from non-Amazon channels, up to every 15 minutes.
  * Ensure that you process Amazon orders quickly.
  * Set aside dedicated inventory for Amazon orders.
  * If you use text files, you can simplify inventory updates by setting update-delete to partial update, and then use only the SKU and quantity data. The rest of the columns can be left blank.
  * You can add multiple product listings using inventory files. For more information, see [Add your products using inventory files](/gp/help/G201576410).

  
Drop-shipper inventory isn't up to date | 

  * Monitor availability and ship times closely.
  * Synchronize your back-end systems to monitor availability and ship times.

  
Late shipment | Product takes longer to ship than promised | 

  * If you use text files, set an accurate lead-time-to-ship for each SKU.
  * If you use the [Add a Product](/productsearch/) feature, use the handling time field for this purpose. For more information, go to [Add your products using inventory files](/gp/help/G201576410).
  * If you use XML, use the fulfillment latency element.
  * Notify buyers of any errors as early as possible, and cancel the product or order by default.
  * Upgrade automatically to an expedited shipping method if you are shipping an order late.
  * Remove offerings that are consistently shipped late.

  
Buyer missed shipment notification | 

  * Send tracking information with your fulfillment feed.

  
Messy or complicated return | Your return policy restricts full refunds before 30 days | 

  * Provide full product refunds for a standard 30-day period.

  
Your returns policies are complicated, vague, or burdensome | 

  * Rigorously review and clarify the language of the returns policy in your online Amazon Help pages.
  * Streamline and simplify complex returns processes wherever possible.

  
Product not as described | Product image does not accurately depict its features | 

  * Provide clear images at the maximum allowed image size.
  * Offer multiple views of a product for thoroughness and accuracy of detail.
  * Ensure that the images meet all the requirements. For more information, see [Product image requirements](/gp/help/G1881).

  
The size or material is different than expected | 

  * Provide custom sizing charts. For more information, see [Create custom help pages](/gp/help/G201716580).
  * Fully fill out the description and product dimension fields.

  
Wrong size or wrong product | Incorrect product shipped | 

  * Check your packing, picking, and shipping processes for issues that cause errors.
  * Check that your SKU matches to the right product on Amazon.

  
Product quality | Buyer not satisfied with product quality | 

  * Describe your product carefully. Do not use phrases like "high-quality" for a product whose best attribute is its low price.
  * Remove products that consistently cause negative feedback.
  * Include usage instructions on the product detail page and in shipment.

  
Customer service issue | Buyers cannt reach your customer service department | 

  * Make sure that your customer service phone number and email address are correct in your online Amazon Help pages.
  * Use short, easy-to-type email addresses for customer service.
  * Adjust your spam filter to ensure that incoming buyer messages are not categorized as junk.

  
Buyers are not getting timely responses | 

  * Acknowledge every phone call and email within 24 hours.

  
Removal of feedback | Incorrect feedback | 

  * You can request a removal using the [Feedback Manager](/feedback-manager/index.html#/). Refer to [Request removal of feedback](/gp/help/GSVLUKGSWX9EEM9N).
  * Utilize the option to post a public reply for the feedback received. It will demonstrate your willingness to solve problems to prospective buyers and earn their trust. Refer to [Post a public reply](/gp/help/GFX3VZKQVANVXRRB) and [Can Amazon remove buyer feedback](/gp/help/G20231) for additional details.
