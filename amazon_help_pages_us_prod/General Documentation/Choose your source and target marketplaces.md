Before connecting offers, you need to select a source marketplace and a target
marketplace. You will use the source marketplace as the primary place to
manage your prices. Target marketplace prices for connected offers will update
automatically whenever you change your source marketplace prices.

## Choose your source marketplace

Consider the following when choosing your source marketplace:

  * If you currently sell in only one marketplace, select that as your source marketplace.
  * If you are selling in multiple marketplaces, you may want to select the one in which you have the most offers as your source marketplace.

**Note:** When selecting a second source marketplace, you will see your first
source and target marketplaces on the right side of the screen for reference.
Only marketplaces that you have not already designated as a source or target
marketplace will be available to select as a second source or target
marketplace.

## Choose your target marketplace

Consider the following when choosing target marketplaces:

  * In target marketplaces where you currently have offers, you can keep or delete the existing offers. 
    * If you keep existing offers and the ASIN exists in both the source and target marketplaces, the prices will be synchronized.
    * If you delete existing offers, all offers, histories, and reviews will be deleted. New offers will be created and synchronized where the ASIN exists in both the source and target marketplaces. You cannot undo this action.

On the [Build International Listings](/gp/global-selling/sync-offers) page,
check the box next to each target marketplace where you want to connect. If
you want to apply the same settings to all selected marketplaces, select
**Apply same settings to all marketplaces**.

**Note:** You can [edit your target marketplace settings](/gp/help/202121650)
at any time. The tool will recalculate the prices of your offer in the target
marketplaces whenever you update a price rule. It may take up to four hours
before the price changes are reflected in each target marketplace.
