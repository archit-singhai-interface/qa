## Great detail pages drive sales

A high quality detail page contains the information needed for a customer to
become a buyer. A detail page is composed of the following elements.

#### Product Title

Limit product title to 200 characters (can vary by category). We have found
that the best titles in clothing accurately represent the product and follow
these guidelines:

Brand + Department + Model (if necessary) + Style + Style + Clothing type +
maternity (if applicable) + Multi-pack size (if necessary) + Size-modifier (if
a child item without a parent or the size-modifier represents a unique
product).

Example: Calvin Klein Women's Sleeveless Lace Belted Fit and Flare Dress

In this example, "Calvin Klein" is the brand, "Women's" is the department,
"Sleeveless" is the first style, "Lace Belted" is the second style, and
"Dress" is the clothing-type.

#### Product Description

Be sure to include the basics: fabric content, care, and detailed information
that enhances the image. Incorporating information about the feel of the
garment is a great way to capture the customers' imagination and place them in
a setting where they feel like they are wearing the item. Examples of good
product descriptions:

  * Going places? Wrinkle-resistant and flattering, our pack-&-go knits simplify your life. It keeps up with your office schedule and transitions easily into your evening dinner plans. Contrast-tipping frames the v-neckline, front, cuffs and bottom. Washable. Imported. Rayon or nylon.
  * Cut for active wear, these pure cotton canvas pants might be the most durable and comfortable trousers you have ever worn. Washable faux suede trim on back pockets and D-ring add durability and extended wear. In brown, green, khaki, and stone. Washable. Imported.

Example of a poor product description: Corduroy jacket with front pockets.

#### Bullet Points

These should be equivalent to the "features and benefits" of your product. We
recommend the following format for the 5 bullets:

  * BulletFeature1: Content (For example, material)
  * BulletFeature2: Features and benefits
  * BulletFeature3: Features and benefits
  * BulletFeature4: Features and benefits
  * BulletFeature5: Care or Special Care or Warranty

Example:

  * Made from 100% soft-brushed cotton
  * A comfortable shirt for relaxing weekends
  * Wrinkle-resistant means you won't have to iron it
  * Antiqued wash gives this shirt a "lived-in" look
  * Machine wash warm. Tumble dry

#### Availability messaging

Make the shipping date and pricing chart useful to the customer. Use a back
order date when the product is not immediately available, and make sure the
chart accurately reflects what is in stock.
