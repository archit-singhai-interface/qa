As a Maker, your handmade Artwork products must adhere to the following
guidelines:

  * All products must adhere to [Amazonâ€™s general policies and agreements](/gp/help/G521).
  * All products must adhere to the [Category, product, and listing restrictions](/gp/help/G200301050).
  * All products must meet the overall [Amazon Handmade: Category Listing Policies & Requirements](/gp/help/GNGMMFQ5FPLJFBJP).
  * Artwork must be original and designed or created by you.
  * We realize some products, like prints of your artwork, are sent to an outside printing company due to the cost of the machinery. We will consider this option as long as you are creating the designs and completing the final steps in the production process (packaging and shipping). Include printing methods in the **About section** of your **Maker Profile**.
  * Unauthorized copies or reproductions of artwork that violate any copyright or trademark are not allowed. Read more about [Intellectual Property for Rights Owners](/gp/help/GU5SQCEKADDAQRLZ).
