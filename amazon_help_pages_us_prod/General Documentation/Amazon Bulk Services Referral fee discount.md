Referral fee discounts  
---  
Number of units in case pack or pallet | 2–9 | 10–23 | 24+  
Referral fee discount | 15% | 20% | 25%  
  
## Illustration

The Consumer Electronics category has a referral fee of 8%, as described on
the [Referral fees](/gp/help/GTG4BAWSY39Z98Z3) Help page. The following table
illustrates the referral fee discount calculation for eligible case packs and
pallets in the Consumer Electronics category.

Number of units in case pack or pallet  | 2–9 | 10–23 | 24+  
---|---|---|---  
Referral fee discount | 15% | 20% | 25%  
Discounted referral fee |  8% * (1-15%) = 6.80% |  8% * (1-20%) = 6.40%  |  8% * (1-25%) = 6.00%  
  
Based on the table above, the following discounts will apply:

  * For an eligible case pack or pallet containing 5 units, the referral fee would be 6.80% instead of 8%.
  * For an eligible case pack or pallet containing 15 units, the referral fee would be 6.40% instead of 8%.
  * For an eligible case pack or pallet containing 25 units, the referral fee would be 6% instead of 8%.

_* Amazon reserves the right to cancel or modify the referral fee discount as
it deems appropriate._
