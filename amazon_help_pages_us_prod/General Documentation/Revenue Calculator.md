The [Revenue Calculator](/revcal) is a preview tool that allows you to compare
revenue estimates for products based on the fulfillment channel used. Easily
see which fees apply to each fulfillment option and enter sales volume
estimates to calculate total proceeds, as well as per-unit sold estimates.

**Important:** The fees applied and the profits shown are estimated values and
are subject to change.

## To use the Revenue Calculator for a single product:

  1. **Search or define the product**   
To find a product that already exists on Amazon or in your listings, search by
ASIN or product name. For a product that isn't on Amazon yet, select **Define
product** and provide the dimensions and product category.

**Tip:** Select the country that you're interested in to see relevant products
and fee previews in that country.

  2. **Enter price and shipping charge details**   
If you select an existing product, the price and shipping details will
automatically populate from the [Featured Offer](/gp/help/G37911). For
products not yet listed, you can update the **Item price** and **Shipping
charge** for seller fulfillment at any time.

To estimate US FBA inbound placement service fees for FBA programs, select the **Inbound placement options** , **Number of locations** , and **Inbound regions** in the Inbounding Cost section of the Revenue Calculator. Provide your **Shipping cost (per shipment)** to Amazon to include shipping cost per unit in your **Inbounding Cost** total, cost per unit, and net profit calculations for the product.

  4. **Enter cost estimates**   
To get accurate estimates of profit per unit, enter an estimated cost of goods
sold for each fulfillment option. Include your estimated fulfillment costs and
any other fees that you may incur, such as FBA bagging and labeling service
add-ons.

  5. **Compare fees and profitability from a third program**   
Open the **Select program to compare** menu to choose a third set of fee
estimates and profitability to compare from.

If the program has an upcoming fee change, multiple fee estimates could be
available for the same program.

  6. **Adjust fields to explore**   
Each time you change a field, the Revenue Calculator will recalculate the net
profit and fee estimate values.
