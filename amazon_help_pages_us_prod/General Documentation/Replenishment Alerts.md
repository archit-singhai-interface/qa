On this page you will learn how Replenishment Alerts can help you manage your
inventory without having to constantly monitor each listing.

Replenishment Alerts enable you to manage your inventory in Amazon's
fulfillment centers without needing to constantly monitor each listing. You
can set the alert quantity for individual products or groups of products. When
the listing's fulfillable quantity reaches your threshold, either in units or
weeks-of-cover (the number of weeks of on-hand fulfillable inventory based on
your sales over the last 30 days), we notify you by sending you a
Replenishment Alert e-mail.

##  Tips for setting replenishment alerts

When you select an alert quantity for a given product, select a quantity based
on your average sales and the time it takes to order and ship stock to a
fulfillment center. For example, if it takes you two weeks to order and ship a
product, and you sell about 100 units of that product in a week, it would be
advisable to set the alert quantity to at least 300 units. When your
fulfillable inventory for that product reaches 300 units in our fulfillment
centers, we will notify you. This will give you three weeks to place an order
with your vendors and send in a shipment to our fulfillment center before your
inventory is depleted.

Alternately, when you a select **a weeks-of-cover threshold** , you should
select the number of weeks that it takes you to order and ship stock for that
product to Amazon fulfillment centers.

##  Setting alerts

To configure Replenishment Alerts:

  * Click the **Inventory** tab at the top of the Seller Central page, then click on **Manage FBA Inventory**.
  * On the **Amazon-Fulfilled Inventory** page, check the listings for which you want to set Replenishment Alerts for.
  * From the **Apply to Selected Item(s)** pull-down menu, select **Set Replenishment Alerts** and click **Go**.
  * On the **Set Inventory Replenishment Alerts** page, enter the threshold in the **Alert Threshold** field. You can set each product's threshold separately, choosing either **when Weeks-of-Cover reaches (weeks)** or **when fulfillable quantity reaches (units)** and inputting a numeric value in the cell.

##  Identifying replenishment alerts

You can identify listings with Replenishment Alerts from the **Inventory
Amazon Fulfills** page. A gold bell will appear in the **Fulfillable** column
next to the quantity. If the inventory has reached the replenishment alert
quantity, the bell will turn red.
