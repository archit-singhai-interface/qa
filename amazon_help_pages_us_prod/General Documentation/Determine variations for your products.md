Good variation relationship listings allow buyers to compare and choose
products based on different attributes such as size, color, or other
characteristics from the available options on a single product detail page. If
your products fulfill the following requirements, typically they are good
candidates for a variation:

  * The products are fundamentally the same.
  * The products are under the same brand name.
  * The products vary only in a few very specific ways.
  * Buyers expect to find these products together on a single product page.
  * Products could share a single title.

## When to use variation relationships

The following questions can help you to determine whether certain products are
valid variations:

  * Are the products fundamentally the same (i.e. the similarities of the ASIN's design and function are so basic as to be hard to alter resolve, or overcome)?
  * Could the products share the same title?
  * Do the products vary only in a few, specific ways that do not alter the core essence and nature of the item (such as color or size)?
  * Would customers expect to find these products together on a single product detail page?

If your product does not fulfill the following requirements, they are probably
not a good candidate for variation:

  * There is only one variation of your product.
  * The products are fundamentally different from each other.
  * The products share different brand name.
  * The products require completely different product descriptions. 
  * The products cannot be described by a single product title. 
  * A customer would not expect to find the products together on the product page. 

**Note:** Amazon may remove products that do not correctly use established
variation themes. To learn how to list parent and child products, see [Create
parent-child relationships](/gp/help/G202135320).

The following table illustrates different kinds of variations:

Single Variations  | The products vary in one configuration only and buyers can make purchasing decision based on the difference between these configurations. For example, scarf with different colors.  
---|---  
Double Variations  | The products vary in two configurations and buyers can make purchasing decision by comparing those configurations. For example, dress with different colors and sizes.  
No Variations  | The product exists in one configuration only.  
  
**Examples of good variations:**

  * Identical products that vary only by color:

  * A product that is available in different scents:

##  Tips for creating variations

Do | Do not  
---|---  
  
  * Describe each child product fully, so they will be included in browse and search
  * Add the appropriate variation value to the product title
  * Use SKUs to build relationships using field for SKU and parent SKU
  * List the child listings in the parent SKU in the product template or XML
  * Make sure variation family does not exceed the limit in [Variation Relationship FAQ](/gp/help/G201951410)

|

  * Create variation families or add children to variation families that are not the same brand or product type
  * Add or create an Item Package Quantity variation (multi-pack) that was not created by the manufacturer
  * Include price and quantity value for the parent products
  * Include variation value in the parent title
  * Choose a variation theme other than what is listed in the approved theme for each product type
  * List different products together
  * Put more than one product characteristic in a variation attribute
  * Introduce large variation family as defined in [Variation Relationship FAQ](/gp/help/G201951410)

  
  
**Important:** Not all related products are valid variations. Amazon reserves
the right to remove the newly-created variations families or children that are
added to a variation family that do not comply with standards outlined above.
Variation families with more than 2000 child ASINs will not be displayed on
the detail page.

## Examples of bad variations

  * Individual bath gel, shampoo, and scented powder (separate SKUs) that are of the same scent
  * Short sleeve and long sleeve t-shirts by the same manufacturer 
  * Dinner plates, salad plates, and soup bowls (separate SKUs) with the same pattern 
  * Cellphone cases with screen protectors for the same cellphone model 
  * Body oils with different base ingredients (e.g. avocado oil, castor oil, coconut oil)
