Amazon Managed Service is a fully-managed, end-to-end supply chain solution
that coordinates logistics to unlock faster delivery speeds and higher sales
conversion while reducing complexity. Simply provide your product details and
pickup locations and we’ll oversee the rest, including carrier pickup,
inventory consolidation, strategic replenishment, and placement into
fulfillment centers that are nearest to customers.

To store your products, Amazon Managed Service uses [Amazon Warehousing and
Distribution (AWD)](/asdn/about#learn-service), our low-cost bulk storage
solution with pay-as-you-go pricing. With AWD, we’ll automatically replenish
your products to fulfillment centers based on demand signals to help you
maintain the right FBA inventory levels. There are no fees for enrolling in
AWD, and you’ll be charged only when you send inventory to AWD facilities.

The AWD program is available for a variety of FBA products. When you book
shipments for the program, we’ll validate that the ASINs you’re attempting to
send are eligible. To learn more, go to [AWD product
eligibility](/gp/help/GGTMT4PTMUMHDS6B).

## Amazon managed shipping option

There are two workflows that help you create a shipment to AWD:

  * The [Send to AWD](/gp/help/GB9BMKQPPRW3FFCU) workflow filters your inventory to only show AWD-eligible SKUs. In Seller Central, go to the **Inventory** drop-down menu and select **Warehousing and distribution (AWD)**.
  * The [Send to Amazon](/fba/sendtoamazon/) workflow is a streamlined option that you can use to create shipments to AWD or our fulfillment centers. In step 1 of the workflow, if you create a shipment containing only AWD-eligible inventory, you’ll have an option to send the shipment to AWD when you advance to step 2.

In the Send to AWD workflow, you can choose your preferred shipping option.
When you select the **Amazon managed** ship option, you’ll be assigned Amazon
transportation (through the [Amazon Partnered Carrier
program](/gp/help/G201119120) for domestic shipments). This helps you qualify
for AWD-integrated rates. To learn more, go to [Costs for
AWD](/asdn/about/Costs).

If you select the **Seller managed** option, you can choose your own carrier.

## Amazon Managed Service rates

Effective April 1, 2025, Amazon Managed Service and AWD will introduce new
integrated rates:

  * **Base rate** : If you manually manage replenishment to Amazon fulfillment centers
  * **Amazon managed rate** : If you’re using the Amazon managed ship option to move inventory to AWD and our fulfillment centers

**AWD charges** | **Base rates** | **Amazon managed rate** | **% off from base rate**  
---|---|---|---  
AWD storage fee | $0.48/cubic foot/month | $0.38/cubic foot/month | 20%  
AWD inbound processing fee | $1.35/box | $1.35/box | 0%  
AWD outbound processing fee | $1.35/box | $1.35/box | 0%  
AWD transportation fee | $1.15/cubic foot | $1.04/cubic foot | 10%  
  
The updated AWD storage fee will be first reflected in your May 2025 charge
for storage that’s used in the month of April 2025. The updated AWD processing
and transportation fees are applicable for replenishment orders that are
confirmed on or after April 1, 2025.

## Eligibility for Amazon managed rates

A SKU qualifies for the Amazon managed rate when each of the following occurs:

  * You use Amazon Global Logistics, the Partnered Carrier program, or Amazon Global Selling SEND to inbound inventory.
  * 70% or more of the SKU inventory is sent to our fulfillment centers through AWD auto-replenishment in the preceding 90 days.
  * Sufficient inventory levels are maintained across AWD and Amazon’s fulfillment network for the SKU. 

We’ll provide more details on the criteria for the Amazon managed rate
