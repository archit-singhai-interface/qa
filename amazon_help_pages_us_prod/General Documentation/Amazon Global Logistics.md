## Use Amazon Global Logistics for optimized inventory placement in the US

**Ocean shipping**

Amazon Global Logistics will manage the optimal placement of your inventory
using our integrated network of facilities and warehouses in China and the US.

As part of shipping plan creation in Seller Central, you will be able to view
and compare placement options with respective shipping rates and varying FBA
inbound placement service fees.

Below are the options for optimized inventory placements in the US.

**Amazon Managed Placement**

Effective March 1, 2024, you can use the Amazon Managed Placement (AMP)
service. This service is a box (carton) placement solution that helps us
reduce the placement cost when you adhere to specific shipping requirements.
AGL AMP is a flat per shipment rate solution that includes other destination
charges required for placement. Thus, you will not be charged the FBA inbound
placement service fee separately. This service can be used for both large
bulky (non-sortable) and standard (sortable) cargo types, available in LCL and
FCL, and for both standard ocean and fast ocean (premium service) modes.

The following are the benefits of this service:

  * With this service, Amazon Global Logistics will optimally distribute inventory at the destination on your behalf, allowing you to inbound inventory to one location. Amazon will then split the inventory across multiple fulfillment centers for optimal placement.
  * As you’ll ship to one location, you won’t be required to split purchase orders for multiple destinations and you’ll avoid hassle of multiple customs documentations and shipments tracking. 
  * Through this service, shipments will be inbounded to the facilities close to the destination port, leading to the fastest entry into the Amazon fulfillment network and fastest buyable inventory on receive.
  * If your inventory is high-unit density per container (more units per container), AMP option can lower your total costs.

The following requirements apply to the Amazon Managed Placement service:

  * No more than 2,000 boxes (cartons) can be shipped per 40-foot container.
  * No more than 1,000 boxes (cartons) can be shipped per 20-foot container.
  * Sort types cannot be mixed in a container. Refer to the cargo size details section below.
  * AMP AGL purchase orders must be shipped with AGL AMP shipping option.

For more information, go to [Inbound Defects and
Guardrails](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GVBKGXPUDX8CYNKM).

**Minimal shipment splits**

Effective March 1, 2024, you can select the Minimal shipment splits option to
ship large bulky (non-sortable) cargo and standard-size (sortable) cargo to a
single location in the East or the West Coast destination. The FBA inbound
placement service fee will apply.

If your inventory is low-unit density per container (that is, less units per
container), the Minimal shipment splits option could have a lower FBA inbound
placement service fee per shipment. This option lets you ship goods of the
same sort type to a single Amazon fulfillment center without having to split a
shipment.

This option is also designed so that your inventory is placed closer to the
destination port for fast delivery to customers. This option can be used for
both LCL and FCL, and for both standard ocean and fast ocean modes.

The following requirements apply to the Minimal shipment splits:

  * Sort types cannot be mixed in a container.
  * Ensure that the containers are shipped to the same coast, as mentioned in the original shipping plan in Seller Central.

**High-density units’ example** : The table below is an illustrative example
of total cost of shipping with AMP vs Minimal shipment splits for a 40-foot
FCL container shipping 25,000 units.

Illustrative example on cost calculation | Minimal shipment splits  | Amazon Managed Placement  
---|---|---  
Per-unit FBA inbound placement service fee rate for West region | $0.30 | $0  
FBA inbound placement service fee | $7,500 | $0  
AGL shipment rate* (AMP includes other destination charges for placement) | $5,400 | $8,700   
Total shipping cost (FBA inbound placement service fee + shipping rate) | $12,900 | $8,700  
  
**Low-density units’ example** : The table below is an illustrative example of
total cost of shipping with AMP vs Minimal shipment splits for a 40-foot FCL
container shipping 4,000 units.

Illustrative example on cost calculation | Minimal shipment splits  | Amazon Managed Placement  
---|---|---  
Per-unit FBA inbound placement service fee rate for West region | $0.49 | $0  
FBA inbound placement service fee | $1,960 | $0  
AGL shipment rate* (AMP includes other destination charges for placement) | $5,400 | $8,700   
Total shipping cost (FBA inbound placement service fee + shipping rate) | $7,360 | $8,700  
  
**Note:** The above shipping rates and FBA inbound placement service fee are
illustrative and actual rates may vary. To view our shipping rates, go to the
AGL shipment rates section. For more information on FBA fee, go to [FBA
inbound placement service fee](/gp/help/GC3Q44PBK8BXQW3Z).

**Ship to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution**

With Ship to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD), you can enjoy the
benefits of an integrated, low-cost bulk storage solution that helps you stay
in stock for FBA. AWD pricing covers FBA inbound placement services, therefore
no separate inbound placement service fee is charged.

With this service, we will transport your ocean FCL or LCL shipments from
origin to an Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facility in the US.

Amazon monitors inventory levels for your SKUs in the distribution centers.
When the total supply (both on-hand and to-arrive inventory) goes below the
optimal level, we will automatically replenish inventory in the right
quantities at the right fulfillment centers. This will increase the potential
for same-day and next-day delivery speeds for FBA and Multi-Channel
Fulfillment orders.

By using Amazon Global Logistics to access Amazon Warehousing and Distribution
facilities, you can also access exclusive lower fees.*

For more information, go to [Amazon Warehousing and Distribution
fees](/gp/help/GAYG62Q3MPE6STFS).

**Ship to AWD product eligibility** : Ship to AWD is available for a wide
variety of FBA products. This includes standard size (sortable) and non-
perishable items that don’t have an expiration date. We currently don’t accept
grocery, perishables, hazmat, Amazon devices, gift cards, high-value products,
jewelry, shoes, and watches.

*This program is subject to change or cancellation by Amazon at any time, and other Amazon terms and conditions continue to apply. Ship to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution is offered by Amazon Global Logistics and Amazon Warehousing and Distribution.

**Extra-large size (heavy bulky) inventory**

For heavy bulky items, as the FBA inbound placement service fee doesn’t apply,
you can continue to inbound to a single location with no change in the
shipping process.

## Use Amazon Global Logistics for UK and EU destinations

For destinations in the UK and the EU, you can ship your inventory using ocean
freight. You can choose the standard ocean shipping mode for either FCL or LCL
shipments.

With Amazon Global Logistics, you can ship to a single destination in the UK
and the EU, allowing you to ship goods of the same sort type to a single
Amazon fulfillment center, without having to split the shipment.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Why does Amazon charge a separate fee for inbound placement service? When
will the FBA inbound placement service fee go into effect?

The FBA inbound placement service fee for standard (sortable) and large bulky
(non-sortable) sized items reflects the cost of distributing inventory to
fulfillment centers close to customers. This fee will be effective as of March
1, 2024. Amazon Global Logistics (AGL) will offer you flexible shipment
placement options. Amazon will optimize the inventory distribution within the
fulfillment network, bringing products closer to customers, expediting
delivery time, and decreasing transportation expenses. As part of shipping
plan creation in Seller Central, you will be able to view and compare
placement options with respective shipping rates and varying FBA inbound
placement service fee.

####  **Is there a plan to implement the FBA inbound placement service fee
policy for orders shipped to the UK and the EU?**

The FBA inbound placement service fee does not apply to orders shipped to the
UK and the EU, and there is currently no plan to implement it in these
regions.

####  **What happens to AGL shipments with FBA purchase orders created before
March 1, 2024?**

For purchase orders created before March 1, 2024, for standard and large bulky
sized items shipping directly to destination, while we will utilize the
Minimal shipment splits placement option, you will not incur the FBA inbound
placement service fee as effective date for the FBA inbound placement service
fee is March 1, 2024. Note that the Shippers (through Shipper Central) must
select Minimal shipment splits as inbound method for purchase orders created
before March 1, 2024. For heavy bulky items, as the FBA inbound placement
service fee doesn’t apply, you can continue to inbound to a single location
with no change in the booking and purchase order creation process.

####  **What happens to AGL shipments with FBA purchase orders created on or
after March 1, 2024?**

The FBA inbound placement service fee will be effective starting March 1,
2024. Minimal shipment splits placement option created on or after March 1,
2024, will incur the FBA inbound placement service fee, which will be charged
by FBA within 45 days after the goods are received in the warehouse. Amazon
Managed Placement (AMP) purchase orders created on or after March 1, 2024,
will not incur the FBA inbound placement service fee separately as the AGL AMP
flat rate includes other destination charges required for placement. For heavy
bulky items, as the FBA inbound placement service fee doesn’t apply, there is
no change in the booking and purchase order creation process.

####  **What is the impact of FBA inbound placement service fee on shipping
heavy bulky items?**

For heavy bulky items, there is no change in the process. As the FBA inbound
placement service fee doesn’t apply to heavy bulky items, therefore AMP and
Minimal shipment splits placement options are not applicable. You can continue
to inbound to a single location with no change in the shipping process.

####  **Does AGL still offer merchant preferred fulfillment or fulfillment
center locking services? If not, why is these services not needed?**

Starting March 1, 2024, Amazon will place your inventory optimally at the
destination, no longer requiring merchant preferred fulfillment or fulfillment
center locking services. With AMP, you can send your inventory to one location
and we will then spread the inventory across multiple fulfillment centers for
optimal in-stock placement. With Minimal shipment splits service, you can ship
goods into a single destination in the East or the West Coast without having
to split a shipment.

####  **How is AGL the fastest entry point into Amazon network vs non-AGL
(third-party solutions)?**

When you use AGL, with both AMP and Minimal shipment splits placement options,
it is the fastest way to enter Amazon network with shipments becoming buyable
faster. Your inventory becomes buyable upon first receive in the Amazon
facility. AGL inbounding facilities are closer to the destination ports
resulting in products being buyable faster upon receiving in these facilities.

####  **What changes in user experience will go into effect when placing
orders through Seller Central starting March 1, 2024?**

To ship directly to the destination via Seller Central, starting March 1,
2024, you will see a new shipping placement option for AMP. This option will
allow you to ship to one location which Amazon will then split to multiple
destinations, incurring no FBA inbound placement service fee. The displayed
rates for AMP are of shipping cross border and other destination charges
required for placement. Thus, you will not be charged the FBA inbound
placement service fee separately. You will also see the option to book Minimal
shipment splits to ship to a single location, incurring FBA inbound placement
service fee. You will be able to compare AGL shipping rates and estimated FBA
inbound placement service fee associated with your shipment. The booking
experience does not change for shipping heavy bulky items and Ship to AWD
service.
