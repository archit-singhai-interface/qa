Promotions can help your products stand out from the competition and stimulate
sales. However, promotions are most effective when your offer is the Featured
Offer. Otherwise, the promotional messaging cannot appear on the detail page.
For more information on becoming the Featured Offer, go to [How the Featured
Offer works](/gp/help/G37911).

## When to create a promotion

Consider creating a promotion when business is slow so that you can motivate
both existing and new customers to buy. You can also distinguish your offer
from the competition and encourage existing customers to try new products.

There are several options you can choose from when creating a promotion:

  * Percentage-off 
  * Buy one, get one for free

**Note:** To be eligible to create a percentage-off promotion or a buy one,
get one for free promotion, you must be a Professional seller with a [seller
feedback rating](/gp/seller-rating/pages/feedback-
manager.html/ref=xx_feedback_dnav_help) of at least 2.5 stars. Sellers who
haven't received a feedback rating yet are also eligible.

## Successful promotions

Successful promotions motivate customers to buy your product. To run an
effective promotion, consider the following guidelines:

  * **The customer must know about it.** Consider running social media campaigns to drive traffic to your promotion.
  * **It is time-sensitive.** Customers respond to limited-time offers when they face the possibility of missing the offer. Experiment with the duration, depending on your product.
  * **It offers sufficient value to influence the customer's choice.** Track current sales and gather feedback to really figure out what offers your potential customers find more attractive. Then you will have some solid understanding to be able to refine your promotions accordingly.

**Note:** When considering running promotions for your products, keep in mind
that promotions cannot be offered as an incentive for customer reviews, either
explicitly or implicitly. Customer reviews for purchases made with promotions
might not necessarily get the “Amazon Verified Purchase” badge.

## Restrictions

Amazon restricts the following categories from certain kinds of promotional
offers:

  * Books, Music, Video and DVD (BMVD) products are excluded from promotions.
