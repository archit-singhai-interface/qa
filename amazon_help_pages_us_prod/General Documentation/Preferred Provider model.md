## Get recognized for your great performance  
  
In an effort to ensure Amazon rewards the top performing providers and at the
same time buyers receive the best service, we created the Preferred Provider
model. Through this, Amazon rewards qualifying providers with the exclusivity
to see and claim jobs before all other providers! This will ensure Amazon
buyers have a top provider complete their order and supports providers with
more job opportunities.

## How it works

  * If your business meets the performance requirements (link to H2) on a service area and profession level, you'll automatically be opted into the model.
  * Provider performance is evaluated weekly within the enabled professions and areas. 
  * If your business is opted-in to the Preferred Provider model, you will see new jobs to claim on a service area and profession level before non-qualifying providers, increasing your chances of winning more jobs. 
  * There is no limit to the number of providers that can be in the Preferred Provider model, so any provider that meets the bar in one of the 9 applicable professions will be added in. This means there can be multiple Preferred Providers in a specific profession and service location.
  * If your business fails to meet the performance requirements at any time, you'll automatically be opted out of the model. At a later time, if you meet the minimum performance bar, you will be added back into the model.
  * Your account will not be affected in any other way.
