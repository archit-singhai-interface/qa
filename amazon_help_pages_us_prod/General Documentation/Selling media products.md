You can list items in our Books, Music, and Video & DVD (BMVD) categories
using the **Add a Product** tool (**Inventory** link > **Add a Product**). If
you are on the Professional selling plan, you can also list items in bulk in
these categories if you use inventory file template release 1.4 or 4.1. If you
are approved to sell in the Textbook Rentals category, please reach out to
your rental contacts for questions regarding templates.

**Video, DVD & Blu-ray products**

We are enacting listing restrictions to preserve customer trust in the Amazon
website. Access the [Video, DVD, & Blu-ray](/gp/help/201607580) Help page to
learn how you can apply to sell restricted DVDs.

**Music products**

As part of our ongoing efforts to provide a great shopping experience, we have
implemented additional selling qualifications for products in the Music & CD
category. Access the [Music & CDs](/gp/help/202188990) Help page to learn more
about selling products in this category.

Sellers are required to ship all Books, Music, Video and DVD products within
two business days of the date the order confirmation is made available to you.
Shipping rates and service options are set by Amazon. For more information,
