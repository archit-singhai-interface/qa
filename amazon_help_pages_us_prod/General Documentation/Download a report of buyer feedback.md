You can download a report for all neutral (3 stars) and negative (1 and 2
stars) feedback you have received from buyers within a selected period of up
to one year. This report is in tab-delimited text-file format (.txt) and
contains all the data you see in the **View current feedback** table in
[Feedback Manager](/gp/seller-rating/pages/feedback-manager.html).

**Note:** It can take up to 45 minutes to generate the report, and larger
reports will take longer. You don't need to stay on this page while the report
is generating; return later to download your completed report.

To generate a feedback report:  

  1. In [Feedback Manager](/gp/seller-rating/pages/feedback-manager.html), select **Download feedback reports**.
  2. On the **Feedback Reports** page, select a report from **Select report type**.
  3. Select the time span for the report from **Select days**.
  4. Click **Request report** to generate a report.
  5. In the **Download** column, you can view the report status and availability. Click **Refresh** to update the status. When your report is ready, the status will change from "Not Ready" to a download button.
  6. Click **Download** to download your report.

**Note:** The current retention period for report requests and the associated
output files is 30 days. You will not have access to previously generated
feedback reports if they are aged greater than 30 days.
