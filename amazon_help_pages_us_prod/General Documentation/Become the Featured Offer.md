Featured Offers are offers for new products that we display on a product
detail page with an **Add to Cart** option that customers can use to add items
to their shopping carts. When one of your items appears in this way on a
product page, we call it the Featured Offer.

There are two steps to select offers to feature. First, we determine which
items are eligible to be featured based on criteria that are designed to give
customers a great shopping experience. Second, from this pool of eligible
offers, we choose compelling offers to feature.

This help topic deals with the second step, selection. To be considered for
selection as the Featured Offer, first make sure that both you and your listed
items are [eligible](/gp/help/200418100). Selection then looks at a number of
factors to identify the offers that customers are most likely to want,
including price, availability, delivery speed, and customer service.

Watch the below video to learn about Featured Offer eligibility and
strategies.

## I. Price your items competitively

There are a few ways to check and make sure you're pricing your items
competitively.

  * Visit the [Manage Pricing](/inventory?viewId=PRICING&ref_=myi_mp_vl_fba) page where the Featured Offer Price column shows the winning offer, even if it isn’t yours.
  * See [Pricing Health](/hz/pricing/dashboard) for real-time data about your prices and how they compare to other offers.

## II. Offer faster shipping and free shipping

Sellers who offer faster shipping options are more likely to win the Featured
Offer. You can look up your available options in [Shipping
settings](/hz/shipping).

**Note:** Only items that a seller can ship to the customer's shipping address
are eligible to win the Featured Offer.

## III. Provide great customer service

We measure customer service in several different ways, and you can check your
[Account Health](/gp/seller-rating/pages/account-health.html) to see how
you're doing. While certain metrics such as [Order defect
rate](/gp/help/200285170), [Cancellation rate](/gp/help/200285210), and [Late
shipment rate](/gp/help/200285190) can weigh more heavily when considering
Featured Offer status, we consider all the available metrics.

Staying tuned in to all aspects of your account health is a great way to
ensure that you are working toward becoming the Featured Offer and earning
customer respect and trust.

## IV. Keep stock available

You can't win the Featured Offer if you're out of stock. Keep your inventory
updated and plan accordingly for things that sell quickly.

##  Other options if you don’t win the Featured Offer

Listings that do not win the Featured Offer are eligible for placement in the
[Other sellers on Amazon](/gp/help/200418110) box. However, Amazon does not
guarantee placement in either of these locations.
