Amazon sets the default transit time for new [shipping
templates](/gp/help/201834090), as shown in the tables below. The default
transit time is the setting that is automatically populated when you create a
new template. If you are not able to meet the maximum allotted default transit
time with your current carrier, then you must set different timelines in your
shipping templates.

## Default transit times for domestic sellers

The recommended transit time to all states in the continental US (all states
in the contiguous US, excluding Hawaii, Alaska, and US protectorates) is two
to four business days.

Region | Ship-from country | Destination | Default transit time | Available transit time options  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 | US | Continental US (all states in the contiguous US, excluding Hawaii, Alaska, and US protectorates)  | 2-4 days |  2-3 days 2-4 days 5-8 days *  
2 | US | Hawaii, Alaska | 5-8 days |  2-3 days 2-4 days 5-8 days 7-14 days  
3 | US |  US protectorates  Army Post Office (APO) / Fleet Post Office (FPO) | 14-28 days |  5-10 days 7-14 days 14-28 days  
  
*Standard shipping: For all SKUs, except for media (such as Books, Magazines, and DVDs), the standard shipping transit time will be calculated using five days if 5-8 days is set. This only applies to the continental US (all states in the contiguous US, excluding Hawaii, Alaska, and US protectorates). Free economy: For all SKUs (including media) the free economy shipping transit time will allow a maximum setting of eight days, which applies to all US destinations.
