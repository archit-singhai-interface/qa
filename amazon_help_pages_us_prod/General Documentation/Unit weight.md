## Determine the unit weight

For new products, weigh your fully packaged product. Oz and lb are both used
as inputs to fee calculations in the US.

**Important:** If a product is sold as a set, the weight and dimensions are
the combined total of all of the items in the set packaged together.

For products you currently have in FBA inventory, you can look up your unit
weight using the [Fee Preview](/reportcentral/ESTIMATED_FBA_FEES/1) report. To
do so:  

  1. Download the report.
  2. Identify the product you are looking for by its FNSKU.
  3. View the unit weight in the **item-weight** field.

For products that are already being sold on Amazon but you do not sell, you
can look up the unit weight using the [Revenue
calculator](/fba/profitabilitycalculator/index). To do so:  

  1. Search for the product of interest.
  2. View the **Unit weight** value.

**Note:** Amazon may verify the weight and dimensions of a product using
representative samples. Amazon’s information about a product’s weight and
dimensions will be used to calculate fees if there is a difference between
Amazon’s information and a seller’s information. Amazon may change its
information about a product’s weight and dimensions from time to time to
reflect updated measurements. Fees based on the weight and dimensions of a
product are calculated using Amazon’s information about the weight and
dimensions of that product at the time the fee is calculated.

## Frequently asked questions

#### How is unit weight different from shipping weight?

Unit weight is used as an input to calculate the shipping weight. Shipping
weight also takes into account the dimensional weight in certain cases. For
more information, go to [Shipping weight](/gp/help/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY).
