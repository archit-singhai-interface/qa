The **Featured Offer** is the offer near the top of a product detail page,
which customers can buy now or add to their shopping carts.

A key feature of the Amazon website is that multiple sellers can offer the
same product. If more than one eligible seller offers a product, they may
compete to become the Featured Offer for that product (as long as it can be
shipped to the customer's address).

To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet
performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer
placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased
sales.

## How is the Featured Offer percentage calculated?

The Featured Offer percentage is calculated as the total page views in which
you are the Featured Offer divided by the total page views received by
products you list. Only active items are considered. You will see ‘—‘ if we
are unable to calculate your Featured Offer percentage.
