**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, charging for
preparation, or for non-compliance at the fulfillment center.

Any product for children younger than age 4 that has an exposed surface
greater than 1"x1" must be packaged so that it will not be damaged during
receipt, stocking, shipment preparation, or shipment to the customer. Products
for children under age 4 that are not contained in a sealed, six-sided
package, or have an opening greater than 1"x1" must be shrink-wrapped or
placed in a sealed poly bag.
