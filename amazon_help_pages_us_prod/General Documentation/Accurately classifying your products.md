Customers shopping on Amazon discover products by searching and browsing.
Accurate product classification optimizes discoverability, making it easier
for Amazon to help customers find what they're looking for through search and
browse.

Accurately classifying products is like placing your products in the correct
aisle and on the correct shelf in the store. Just as in a store, if your
product shines on that shelf with comprehensive product information, quality,
and pricing, coupled with positive feedback, then you just won over a new
customer.

## Why should you classify your products accurately?

Amazon may restrict shopping results to return products that belong to
specific item type keyword when customers search in All Departments. This is
done in an effort to provide high-quality shopping results. Insufficient
browse classification can hinder a product’s discoverability for relevant
search queries.

For example, when customers search for a product by typing the keywords
‘gluten free brownie mix’, the shopping results may only display products
categorized under this specific Item Type Keyword: “brownie mixes”. This is
because the customer is specifically looking for brownie mix products.

If a brownie mix is classified at a broader level like Item Type Keyword:
“cooking-and-baking-supplies”, it may not appear in shopping results for
otherwise relevant queries (For example: 'brownie mix'). Therefore, it is
imperative to classify a brownie mix at the most granular level, such as
‘brownie mixes’, rather than a broader category, to optimize discoverability
and customer satisfaction.
