Placing your inventory closer to customers improves the delivery speed of
their orders, driving higher customer satisfaction and more sales for you. It
also enables more efficient use of our fulfillment network.

We’re making the following updates to the FBA inbound placement service fee:

  * We are lowering inbound placement service fees for large bulky-size products an average of $0.58 per unit for minimal shipment splits. This change is effective January 15, 2025.
  * We will waive the inbound placement service fee for new parent ASINs that qualify for the FBA New Selection program and are included in shipments created between December 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. These items will be exempt from the inbound placement service fee up to the first 100 inbounded units per new parent ASIN.

## FBA inbound placement service

When you create a shipping plan, you can select one of the following inventory
inbound placement options:

  * **Minimal shipment splits** : Send your inventory to the minimal number of inbound locations, generally to a single location, for a fee, and we’ll decide on your behalf how to place the inventory across our network. The fee may vary by inbound location—for example, there may be higher fees for shipments sent to locations in the West compared to other parts of the country.
  * **Partial or Amazon-optimized shipment splits** : Send your inventory to multiple inbound locations yourself for a reduced or no fee. The reduced fees will depend on the number of shipments and inbound locations that you send your inventory to. To qualify for the Amazon-optimized inbound option with no inbound fee, your shipments must include at least five identical cartons or pallets per item. Each carton or pallet must contain the same quantity per item and the same item mix. You can review examples in the FAQ below. If you select the placement option in which you send your inventory to a partial number of inbound locations, generally two or three, you will pay a reduced fee.

The availability of these inbound placement options is based on several
factors, including the product types and quantities in your shipping plan,
your existing inventory levels across our network, location of customer
demand, and capacity availability in our fulfillment centers.

## FBA inbound placement service fee

The table below outlines the per-unit FBA inbound placement service fees. When
you create a shipping plan, you’ll see a fee estimate for each available
inbound placement option. You’ll be charged the FBA inbound placement service
fee 45 days after your shipment is received, based on the quantities received.

The fee may be adjusted periodically within the ranges listed in Table 1 and
Table 2, and will vary based on several factors, including, but not limited
to, the following:

  * **Item size:** Whether the item is small standard, large standard, or large bulky.
  * **Weight** : Unit weight for small standard. We’ll use the greater of dimensional weight or unit weight for large standard and large bulky.
  * **Number of shipment splits** : Minimal, partial, or Amazon-optimized shipment splits. 
  * **Inbound location** : The location of the fulfillment center that you’re shipping to. For instance, there may be higher fees for shipments sent to inbound locations in the West compared to other parts of the country, or locations with limited capacity availability.

**Note:** The FBA inbound placement service fee does not apply to extra-large-
size products. For more information, go to [Product size
tiers](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W).

We may verify the weight and dimensions of a product using representative
samples. Our information about a product’s weight and dimensions will be used
to calculate fees if there’s a difference between Amazon’s information and a
seller’s information. We may change the information about a product’s weight
and dimensions from time to time to reflect updated measurements.

## Frequently asked questions

#### How is the FBA inbound placement service fee calculated?

The FBA inbound placement service fee rate is assessed based on product size
tier, shipping weight, and inbound locations. The fee is also based on the
tier for the number of locations or number of shipments in your shipping plan.

Below is an example of how inbound placement fees are charged 45 days after
each shipment is received.

**Example:** Minimal shipment split option with one inbound location in the
West region.

Sample product |  Size tier: Large standard Shipping weight: 12 oz or less Quantity: 100  
---|---  
FBA inbound placement service selected |  Location or locations: One location or shipment, West region Minimal shipment splits rate per unit: $0.34 (West region)  
FBA inbound placement service fee (charged 45 days after initial receive) | Total fee: 100 units x $0.34 = $34.00  
  
#### Is the Amazon-optimized option or minimal shipment splits option best for
me to send my inventory to Amazon?

The Amazon-optimized shipment splits option offers no inbound placement
service fee if you're able to pack at least five identical cartons or pallets.
This option requires packing cartons or pallets with the same quantity per
item and the same item mix, as well as arranging transportation to fulfillment
center locations throughout the US.

The minimal shipment splits option provides the simplicity of sending
inventory to one location within a geographic region of your choosing, for a
fee. There are no carton or pallet packing requirements if you send your
inventory with the minimal shipment splits option.

There’s also a partial shipment splits option that allows you to send
inventory to 2-3 locations for a reduced fee, as compared to paying the
minimal shipment splits fee.

#### How do I receive the Amazon-optimized shipment splits inbound option?

To qualify for the Amazon-optimized inbound option with no inbound placement
service fee, your shipments must include at least five identical cartons or
pallets per item. Each carton or pallet must contain the same quantity per
item and the same item mix.

Below are examples of how the Amazon-optimized eligibility guideline applies:

**Plan** | **Carton** | **Item** | **Quantity** | **Amazon-optimized option** | **Eligibility reason**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | 1 | 1 | 100 | Eligible | All cartons include items 1 and 2, and the quantity for each item is the same across all cartons, so this plan is eligible for an Amazon-optimized option.  
2 | 20

5 | 1 | 100

#### Why does the guideline require five or more identical cartons or pallets
to qualify for the Amazon-optimized option?

We have redesigned our inbound network to improve delivery speeds to
customers. Shipping five or more identical cartons or pallets for each item
provides the minimum quantity required to spread your inventory so that we can
get your products to customers quickly.

#### What can I do to maximize the number of inbound options to select from?

When creating shipments, you’ll only see the inbound placement options your
shipments qualify for. Factors that affect the number of inbound options
include the following:

  * Whether your shipment includes a mix of standard-size items, non-standard-size items, or special handling categories
  * Whether each box contains the same mix and quantities of SKUs
  * Quantities and number of boxes for each item
  * Geographical demand

To maximize the number of inbound options, try the following:

  * Create separate shipments for standard-size items, non-standard-size items, and each of the following categories: apparel, jewelry, shoes, watches, and dangerous goods.
  * Ensure the item mix and item quantities are equal across all boxes.
  * Increase the number of boxes.

#### What happens if I create a shipping plan that includes a combination of
standard-size items, non-standard-size items, or special handling categories?

If you create a shipping plan with a combination of standard-size items, non-
standard-size items (for example, large bulky), or special handling
categories, we may direct your inventory to more than one inbound location,
even if you select the minimal shipment splits option for inbound placement.
In this case, the minimal shipment splits rate will still apply to each
shipment in the shipping plan. You also may not see all of the possible
inbound options that would be available if separate shipments were created for
standard-size, non-standard-size, and special handling items.

**Note:** If you create a shipping plan with a combination of standard-size
items and non-standard-size items, the tier for the number of locations is
determined separately for each category.

#### What happens if I don’t send my inventory to the designated fulfillment
centers in the shipping plan or send incomplete shipments (deleted or
abandoned shipments)?

Shipments that are sent to a location that is different from the shipment plan
(misrouted shipment) or that don’t arrive at our facilities within the time
frame specified per our inbound policies (deleted or abandoned shipment) will
incur FBA inbound service fees based on the actual shipments received and
inbound locations, which may be higher than the estimated fees at the time of
shipment creation.

For instance, if you select the partial shipment splits inbound placement
option to send two shipments to two locations, but only send one of the
shipments, you will be charged the higher minimal shipment splits rate on the
items that we received. Additionally, in this example, you may also be charged
an inbound defect fee for the shipment that you abandoned. For more
information, go to [Inbound defect fees](/gp/help/GL5XA3MNXAJKJE8E).

Below is an example of how the inbound placement service fee will be charged
for non-compliant shipping plans with inbound defects (misrouted or abandoned
shipments).

**Example:** Minimal shipment splits option with one inbound location in which
one shipment is misrouted to the wrong fulfillment center.*

Sample product |  Size tier: Large standard Shipping weight: 12 oz or less Quantity: 100  
---|---  
FBA inbound placement service selected |  Location or locations: One location or shipment, East region Minimal shipment splits rate per unit: $0.23 (East region) Estimated fees at shipment creation: 100 units x $0.23 = $23  
FBA inbound placement service fee (charged 45 days after initial receive) |  Shipment sent to the wrong fulfillment center in West region (misrouted shipment). Charges are incurred based on the location the shipment was received. Minimal shipment splits rate per unit: $0.34 (West region) Total fee: 100 units x $0.34 = $34.00  
  
*Note that these examples do not reflect the inbound defect fee that would also be charged for misrouted, deleted, or abandoned shipments.

#### I create shipments by using Amazon APIs like Marketplace Web Service and
Selling Partner API v0. How can I select which inbound placement service
option I want to use?

Effective December 20, 2024, the Fulfillment Inbound API v0 will no longer be
available. For continued programmatic access to Fulfillment Inbound, migrate
to the [Fulfillment Inbound v2024-03-20 API](https://developer-
docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/fulfillment-inbound-api-v2024-03-20-reference).
The new API provides the same placement options and fees as Send to Amazon.

docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/fulfillment-inbound-api-v2024-03-20-use-case-
guide).

#### If I use Amazon Warehousing and Distribution, how will the inbound
placement service fee affect me?

Amazon Warehousing and Distribution pricing covers FBA inbound placement
services; therefore, no separate FBA inbound placement service fee is charged.
With Amazon Warehousing and Distribution, we’ll manage optimal inventory
placement into Amazon’s network on your behalf. To learn more, go to [Amazon
Warehousing and Distribution](https://sell.amazon.com/programs/warehousing).

#### If I use Amazon Global Logistics, how will the inbound placement service
fee affect me and which inbound placement options will be available?

Amazon Global Logistics will manage optimal placement of your inventory by
using our integrated network of facilities and warehouses in China and the US.
As part of the shipping plan creation in Seller Central, you’ll be able to
view and compare Amazon Global Logistics inbound placement service options,
respective shipping rates, and varying inbound placement service fees.

You can use the following placement options:

  * Amazon Managed Placement service is available for both large bulky and standard-size products. With Amazon Managed Placement, we’ll optimally distribute inventory on your behalf, allowing you to inbound inventory at one location, which we’ll then spread across multiple fulfillment centers for optimal in-stock placement. This service is a box (carton) placement solution that helps us reduce the placement cost when you adhere to specific shipping requirements. It’s a flat per-shipment rate solution that includes other destination charges required for placement. Thus, you won’t be charged an FBA inbound placement service fee separately.
  * You can select the minimal shipment splits option for both large bulky and standard-size items to ship to a single destination in East or West Coast fulfillment centers in the US via Amazon Global Logistics. This option will be subject to the FBA inbound placement service fee for minimal shipment splits.

options?
