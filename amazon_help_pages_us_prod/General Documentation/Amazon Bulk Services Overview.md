Amazon Bulk Services (ABS) can help you grow your bulk business (that is,
sales of case packs and pallets). Bulk business is a high growth opportunity.
Research shows that business customers want to buy in large quantities and
prefer consolidated shipments, but also that they do not find enough case
packs on Amazon.

## Benefits

The Amazon Bulk Services program can lead to improved seller and customer
experience. With ABS, you can:

  * Create **package hierarchy** to link units, case packs, and pallets of a product, creating a connected listing, improving search visibility and offering a detailed page experience in the Amazon store for the customer.
  * Improve fulfillment of case packs and pallets, to limit issues relating to pallets sometimes getting delivered as multiple packages. 
  * Easily manage inventory and pricing of multiple configurations (unit, case pack, pallet) of a product.
  * Receive a 15-25% discount on referral fees for eligible case packs and pallets. For details on referral fee discounts, go to [Amazon Bulk Services: Referral fee discount](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GZUL88U2RJ3LJ9JK).

## Features

The ABS program is a multi-year initiative with features being launched
gradually over time. The following features are currently available:

  * Templates on Seller Central to [create package hierarchies](/gp/help/GQ4S7SV9K4GXH3WX)
  * Referral fee discount on eligible products

The following are some of the to-be-launched features:

  * Unit, case pack, and pallet displayed on the same detail page to enhance case pack and pallet visibility
  * Case pack recommendation page to help you identify new case pack opportunities
  * Web-based interface and API support to create package hierarchies
  * Ability to collectively manage units, case packs, and pallets of a product on the Manage Inventory page

## Program eligibility

  * Only seller-fulfilled offers are currently eligible to participate in the program. We are working on extending support for Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA).
  * You must be brand authorized to be able to create a package hierarchy.
  * Every package configuration (unit, case, pallet) of a product must have a distinct external product ID (such as GTIN or UPC).
  * The program is applicable for hardline and consumables product types.
