If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## Mad honey covered by this policy

Mad honey, also known as "deli bal" or "grayanotoxin honey," is a type of
honey that is produced by bees from the nectar of certain rhododendron and
azalea flowers. Mad honey is different from normal natural or commercially
available honey as it is contaminated with grayanotoxins, which leads to
intoxication or poisoning upon consumption.

## Our policy for mad honey

Customers have to be confident that they'll find a selection of safe,
reliable, and compliant products on Amazon. We donâ€™t allow the listing or sale
of non-compliant or prohibited products. In the interest of safety, mad honey
is prohibited.

If you believe that your product has been incorrectly classified as
prohibited, submit the following information to [madhoney-no-
path@amazon.com](mailto:madhoney-no-path@amazon.com):

  * A list of the ASINs that you believe have been misclassified
