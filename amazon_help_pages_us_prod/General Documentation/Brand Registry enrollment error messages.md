There are three types of error messages that you might encounter while
enrolling in Amazon Brand Registry:

  * Account errors
  * Trademark errors
  * System errors

## Account errors

Error message | What it means and next steps  
---|---  
Your account was engaging in conduct that violates Brand Registry policies, such as, but not limited to, invalid notice submissions through our notice submission channels or tampering with the catalog. |  If you believe that there has been an error in the brand enrollment decision, you can submit an appeal by going to [Brand applications](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/brand/enrollment/manage/applications). Click **Appeal** next to your application that is marked **Ineligible**.  In order to advance your Brand Registry enrollment application, you must submit an appeal. Once you have submitted the appeal with all of the required information, you will receive the first response within three to five days. Note: If you have a seller account that is currently deactivated, you can appeal an action taken on your account by going to [Account health](/performance/dashboard) and clicking **Reactivate your account**.  
Your application or account is related to other Amazon accounts or brands that
have violated Amazon or Brand Registry policies.  
You are associated with one or more selling accounts as a primary owner and
all of them have failed seller verification.  
You have not provided sufficient evidence of branding on your products or
packaging.  
You have a selling account that is de-activated.  
You indicated that you’re a new customer, but an account already exists with the email that you are using to register. |  This error indicates that there is an existing account associated with the email address that you’re using to create a new Brand Registry account. If you already have a Seller Central or Vendor Central account, you can sign into Brand Registry with those same account credentials.  
If you plan to create a Seller Central or Vendor Central account with the credentials that you use to sign into Brand Registry, please create that account first. Then, enroll in Brand Registry using the same credentials so that we can link the accounts.  If you don't plan to create either of these accounts, continue with the Brand Registry enrollment process. |  You received this error because of one or more of the following reasons:

  * You haven’t created a Seller Central or Vendor Central account. 
  * You have a Seller Central or Vendor Central account, but you aren’t currently signed into that account. You must be signed into your seller or vendor account and then sign into Brand Registry using the same credentials. 
  * You don’t want to create a Seller Central or Vendor Central account at this time. If that is the case, restart the enrollment process using the email address that you used to create a Brand Registry account. If you decide to create a seller or vendor account in the future, contact us to connect the account to your Brand Registry account. 

  
  
## Trademark errors
