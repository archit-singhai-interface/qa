If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

**Our policy:** You must comply with all applicable federal laws when selling
plant and seed products. You must also comply with state and local laws
applicable to the jurisdiction into which your products are sold as well as
the jurisdiction from which you ship. For example, many state laws have
shipping label requirements when shipping a live plant. In addition, you are
responsible for obtaining any required licenses and permits and are liable for
any penalties resulting from non-compliance. Plants, plant products, and seeds
may not be imported from outside of the United States.

The following examples of permitted and prohibited listings are not
exhaustive, but should be instructive in evaluating products for listing and
sale.

For sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon, go to [FBA prohibited
products](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G201730840) for
additional product restrictions.

Fertilizers are substances, or a mixture of substances, used to provide
nutrients to a plant in order to increase plant growth or crop yield.
Fertilizer products may be subject to federal, state, and location
