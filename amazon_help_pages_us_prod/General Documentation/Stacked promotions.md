For each promotion created through Seller Central, select if you want to stack
Coupon with Percentage off or Coupon with Buy One Get One promotion. Your
selection will determine which promotions apply at checkout.

  * You must know that Percentage Off promotions and Buy One Get One promotion cannot be stacked. Additionally, multiple Percentage Off promotions or multiple Buy One Get One promotions cannot be stacked at checkout.

  * Only if you select ‘yes, allow stacking’ for both Coupon and (Buy One Get One or Percentage off) the promotion will be stacked, otherwise if any of the option is selected as, ‘No, do not allow stacking’ the promotion will not stack, meaning only the higher benefit of the two promotions will be applied at checkout.

For example, if you create a Coupon for 10% off and a Percentage off promotion
of 20% off for same ASIN and select, ‘Yes, allow stacking’ the customer will
receive both discounts combined, that is 30% off. If the selection is, ‘No, do
not allow stacking’, they will get higher discount of the two, which is 20%
off.

**Important:** We advise that you select these options carefully at the time
of promotion creation as we are not responsible for providing any refund if
you set your promotions to stack by selecting 'Yes, allow stacking'.

**Note:** This feature lets you decide whether you want stack or not. You can
control the number of promotions a customer can redeem at the time of purchase
for the same product. This feature will have no other effect on any aspects of
how Coupon or Percentage Off or Buy One Get One promotion work.

At this time, this feature is available only for Coupon and Percentage Off or
Buy One Get One promotion.

To provide the best experience for our customers, our systems are designed to
detect potential abuse. If the system flags it on any ASIN, We reserve the
right to terminate the Coupon and Percentage Off or Buy One Get One promotion.
