Text, logo, graphics, and watermarks apply to the main image and swatch. If
your images don’t meet the content requirements or they violate the [Selling
Policies and Seller Code of Conduct](/gp/help/external/G1801), we may remove
them. If any image does not meet the requirements, we may suppress the product
listing from search until you provide compliant images. Regarding text, logo,
graphics, and watermarks, our [Product image
requirements](/gp/help/external/G1881) state the following: "No text, logos,
borders, color blocks, watermarks, or other graphics covering the product or
in the background. Products with multiple pieces must be relative in size,
with no one piece enlarged.”

Graphics are allowed on device screens (such as TVs and phones), but must look
realistic and not obscure any part of the product outside of the screen, such
as the screen bezel or buttons.

Synthetic images that represent the product realistically and are
indistinguishable from a good product photo are not text, logo, graphics, and
watermarks.

Our requirements prohibit the following uses of text, logo, graphics, and
watermarks in the image:

  * Text, logo, graphic, or watermark that is not part of the product or that does not represent the actual product
  * Images that contain graphics that extend outside the product area as though pasted into the photo
  * Images that are composites of multiple images of products shown at different scale
  * Additional views of the product or extra features must not be present on the main image. They can be featured in other variants.

**Note:** Claims about the product, such as warranties, regulatory approval,
or promotions, are not allowed in any product image. This includes badging,
such as "stamps of approval," logos, or text that explains product features or
quantity, price, shipping options, copyright notices, email addresses, or
watermarks of any kind.

Below are some examples of text, logo, graphics, and watermarks on the main
image that are not allowed.
