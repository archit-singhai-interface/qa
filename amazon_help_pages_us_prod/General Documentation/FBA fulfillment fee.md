The FBA fulfillment fee (previously known as the "pick and pack" fee) is a
per-unit fee charged to fulfill items to customers for purchases in the Amazon
store. The fee varies depending on an item’s category, size, and weight.

**Program specifics:** The details, calculations, or rates for this fee may
vary for products enrolled in Multi-Channel Fulfillment or receiving Low-Price
FBA rates. For more information, go to [FBA fulfillment fees for Multi-Channel
fulfillment orders](/help/hub/reference/external/G201112650) and [Low-Price
FBA fees](/help/hub/reference/external/GJTAVU7P2W2VE8Q9).

## Fee details

**Time of charge** | When the buyer’s order is shipped  
---|---  
**Fee structure** | Per unit fulfilled. Rate is based on product type, size tier, and shipping weight.  
  
## Values used to calculate fee

**Product size tier** | Product size tiers are measurement categories based on the unit weight, product dimensions, and dimensional weight of a packaged item. Learn how to [determine your product size tier](/gp/help/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W), or use the [Monthly Storage Fees report](/gp/ssof/reports/search.html?recordType=STORAGE_FEE_CHARGES&language=en_US&ref=au_fbafulrpts_cont_GPDC3KPYAGDTVDJP) to view the size tier information for products that you’ve previously sent to fulfillment centers.  
---|---  
**Shipping weight** | Shipping weight is the weight used to determine fees. The shipping weight is calculated based on the item’s unit weight or dimensional weight. Learn how to [determine your product's shipping weight](/gp/help/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY).  
**Dimensional weight** | In certain cases, dimensional weight is used instead of unit weight to determine the shipping weight. Learn how to [calculate dimensional weight](/gp/help/G53Z9EKF8VVZVH29).  
**Fee category** | [Fee categories](/gp/help/GCZM532MZ9A4GU46) determine which rates apply to a particular product for certain fee types.

## Your rates

To help identify which rates apply to your product:  

  1. Go to [Fee category guidelines for your products](/gc/fee-category-guidelines) to determine if your product is considered apparel.
  2. Determine whether your product must be sold through the [FBA Dangerous Goods program](/gp/help/external/GZLZBQ7W6QZRKWWK). To do this, use the **Look up an ASIN tool**. For more information, go to [Dangerous goods identification guide (hazmat)](/gp/help/external/G201003400).
  3. Find the [product size tier](/gp/help/external/GG5KW835AHDJCH8W) and calculate the [shipping weight](/gp/help/external/GEVWP48HPBLEFJEY) with the tables below.
