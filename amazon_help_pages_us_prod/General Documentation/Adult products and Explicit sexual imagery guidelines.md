If you list adult products in Amazon’s online store, you must comply with all
federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to those
products and product listings. We encourage you to carefully review this page,
and other applicable policies and laws before listing adult products.

## Adult products covered by this policy

Our policies apply to any adult product that is designed for use in sexual
activities or sexual wellness. Sexually suggestive products are acceptable for
sale, as long as they do not exploit minors, promote non-consensual sex acts,
or violate local, state, or federal laws. You must adhere to all listing
guidelines.

  * **New condition only:** All sexual wellness products must be in “New” condition only. To learn more, go to [Condition guidelines](/gp/help/G200339950).
  * **No explicit sexual imagery or nudity:** The product, packaging, or listing must not be sexually suggestive or intend to elicit a sexual response.
  * **No profanity or sexually explicit language:** The product, packaging, or listing must not contain any form of profanity, sexually graphic, or explicit language. 
  * **Expiration:** Expiration dates must be clearly displayed on all applicable products.
  * **Clinical tone:** Any language describing a product must be "clinical" in tone. It must be careful, business-like, and straightforward, focusing on product features, benefits and adult uses, directly without sexual innuendo.
  * **Accurate listings:** Provide accurate and complete product information. List adult products and their uses directly, avoid sexual innuendo, and ambiguous or evasive terminology, descriptions, or characters.
  * **Comply with all applicable laws** and shipping restrictions for adult material. 
  * **List products** in the appropriate Sexual Wellness product category.

The Adult Products classification will be applied for the following products
and their accessories. Products covered in this policy include but are not
limited to products in **table 1** below. Products applicable to this policy
**must** be listed under **Health, Household & Baby Care** > **Sexual
Wellness** under the appropriate category. If you fail to list adult products
in the appropriate categories within Amazon’s online store, Amazon reserves
the right to determine the appropriateness of listings on its site, and remove
any listing at any time.
