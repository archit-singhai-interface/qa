**Note:** You must register as a SP-API developer before you register your SP-
API application to start using the API.

**Note:** This feature is available to sellers with [Professional selling
plans](/gp/help/64491).

An application programming interface (API) is a tool which developers can use
to build software applications.

Developers can use the [Shipping API](https://developer-
docs.amazon.com/amazon-shipping/docs/amazon-shipping-api-v2-use-case-guide) to
build applications that let sellers use Amazon Buy Shipping.

Review the [Service Terms](/gp/help/202123940) for use of the Shipping API.

If you want to buy shipping from your seller account, see [Buy shipping
through Seller Central](/gp/help/200202280).

With the Shipping API, you can:

  * Access Amazon Buy Shipping through the Selling Partner API (SP-API).
  * Manage your shipping with a shipping integrator that has adopted the Shipping API.
  * Purchase shipping services directly through the Shipping API.

**Note:** This is only available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, United
Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, India, and Japan.

**Note:** Refer to the [SP-API documentation](https://developer-
docs.amazon.com/amazon-shipping/docs/amazon-shipping-api-v2-use-case-guide) to
know how to fulfill orders for each store via the SP-API.
