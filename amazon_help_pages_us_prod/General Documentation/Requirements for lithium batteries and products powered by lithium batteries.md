Lithium batteries are widely used and characterized by long life, no memory
effect (they don't lose their maximum energy capacity) and slow loss of charge
when not in use. However, lithium batteries can also be dangerous. If damaged,
dropped, crushed, or short-circuited, they can release dangerous amounts of
heat and may ignite. They are also dangerous when exposed to heat. For these
reasons, **lithium batteries are always subject to specific transportation
requirements**.

You must provide all battery-related information for your product when
creating a listing or converting a listing to FBA. If the battery information
that you provide is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise conflicting, your
product may be blocked for sale through FBA. You must also upload a battery
exemption sheet on [Manage dangerous goods classification](/fba/compliance-
dashboard/index.html).

For more information, go to [Dangerous goods required information and
documentation (hazmat)](/gp/help/201371860) and the following websites:

Use the **Look up an ASIN** tool to check the classification status of your
FBA ASIN.

**Important:** Lithium battery products may be subject to requirements beyond
those for dangerous goods. For a list of potentially affected products, go to
[Product compliance](/gp/help/XMGGPL6LC4CVXHT) page.

## Recognize lithium batteries

Products don’t have a specific sticker or symbol that indicates the presence
of lithium batteries. But you can easily recognize the batteries in a few
ways:

  * Look at the battery itself. The composition is usually printed on the battery.
  * Read manufacturer documentation such as the product manual. You can also contact the supplier to learn more about your product.

## Types of lithium batteries

There are many different types of lithium batteries. The three main types are
described here.

#### Lithium-ion batteries

Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion or LIB batteries) have lithium compounds as the
electrode material, and are **rechargeable**. Li-ion batteries are widely used
in portable electronic products such as mobile phones, laptops, tablets, MP3
players, and cameras.

#### Lithium metal batteries

Lithium metal batteries have lithium metal as an anode and are **generally not
rechargeable**. They come in different shapes and forms, including the flat,
round batteries used in watches. They are also commonly used in products such
as calculators or flashlights.

#### Lithium-ion polymer batteries

Lithium-ion polymer batteries, often called lithium polymer batteries (Li-
poly, Li-Pol, LIP, PLI or LiP) are **rechargeable** batteries usually composed
of several identical secondary cells in parallel. They are used in some
portable electronic products and fall under the family of lithium-ion
batteries.

* **Energy content in watt-hours (Wh)**

The watt-hour information is generally printed on the battery itself, on its
packaging, or in the manufacturer's documentation.

In cases where the watt-hour is not printed, it can be calculated from the
battery voltage (V) and amp-hour (Ah) rating, also commonly printed on the
battery, the outer packaging, or in the manufacturer's documentation. The
voltage to be used when calculating watt-hours is the **nominal voltage** of
the battery (commonly printed as simply "voltage"), not to be confused with
the input voltage, output voltage, or maximum charging voltage.

## Battery

Two or more cells or batteries which are electronically connected together and
fitted with devices necessary for use, for example, case, terminals, marking
or protective devices. Units which have two or more cells that are commonly
referred to as “battery packs”, “modules” or “battery assemblies” having the
primary function of providing a source of power to another piece of equipment
are treated as batteries.

## Cell

A single encased electrochemical unit (one positive and one negative
electrode) which exhibits a voltage differential across its two terminals, and
may contain protective devices.

## Single Cell Battery

A cell externally fitted with devices necessary for use in equipment or
another battery which it Is designed to power, for example protective devices.

The watt-hour information is generally printed on the battery itself, on its
packaging, or in the manufacturer's documentation.

In cases where the Watt-hour information is not printed, it can be calculated
from the battery voltage (V) and amp-hour (Ah) rating, also commonly printed
on the battery, the outer packaging, or in the manufacturer's documentation.
The voltage to be used when calculating watt-hours is the **nominal voltage**
of the battery (commonly printed as "voltage"), not to be confused with the
input voltage, output voltage, or maximum charging voltage.

## United Nations test summary requirement

As of January 1, 2020, UN 38.3 requires lithium battery manufacturers and
distributors to provide a document known as a **lithium battery test summary**
upon request. This requirement will be enforced via country-specific
regulations.

When manufactured, all lithium batteries and lithium battery products must
undergo a series of standardized tests to confirm their safety for use and
transport. UN 38.3 summarizes those testing requirements.

To comply with this regulation, Amazon requires all sellers to [upload a test
summary](/fba/lithium-battery-test-summary/index.html) at ASIN setup.
