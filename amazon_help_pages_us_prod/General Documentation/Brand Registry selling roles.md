There are two different types of roles that can be assigned to users in Amazon
Brand Registry: protection roles and selling roles. Selling roles, which
include Brand Representative and Reseller, determine which brand selling
benefits users can access.

[Protection roles](/help/hub/reference/GCF9UE9VGKGA2W5F), which include
Administrator, Rights Owner, and Registered Agent, are assigned separately and
determine which tools users can access in Brand Registry.

Both selling roles and protection roles can only be assigned or removed by the
Administrator.

**Note:** Selling roles do not grant access to brand protection benefits, such
as the Report a Violation tool. Brand protection benefit access is controlled
by protection roles. You can learn more about protection roles by going to
[Brand Registry protection roles](/help/hub/reference/GCF9UE9VGKGA2W5F).

## Available selling roles

There are two selling roles that an Administrator can assign:

  * **Brand Representative** : A seller who is directly employed by your brand
  * **Reseller** : An external, third-party seller that sells your brand’s products in Amazon’s store 

## Brand selling benefits

Brand selling benefits are a set of tools and programs that we offer to
registered users. These benefits can help you manage your branded products and
increase the visibility of your brand to customers. The below table lists the
programs and benefits that are available to each selling role.

## Assign selling roles to selling partner accounts

**Note:** Only the Administrator can assign roles.

To assign a selling role to a Seller Central account, the brand Administrator
must follow these steps in Brand Registry:  

  1. Click **Manage** at the top of the page, and then select **Manage selling accounts**.
  2. Click **Connect a selling account**.
  3. Choose the type of selling role that you want to assign, either **Brand Representative** or **Reseller**.
  4. Select one of your accounts or **Other account** from the drop-down menu. 
     * If you select **Other account,** provide a merchant token for the seller that you want to invite to your brand. The seller can get their merchant token from their Seller Central account. 
  5. Choose one of your registered brands from the drop-down list. 
  6. Click **Connect selling account**.

The seller will receive an email with instructions to accept the invitation
through Seller Central. After they accept, the selling role will show as
active on the **Connected** tab of the **Manage selling accounts** page.

You can invite and connect as many seller accounts to your brand as you would
like.

**Note:** If the seller has a problem accepting your invitation, go to the
Brand Registry Support page and select **Technical issue**. In the box labeled
“Please describe your issue,” include “error code 6789.”

To assign a selling role to a Vendor Central account, the vendor must contact
their vendor manager.

## Manage selling roles

To update or change selling roles that have already been assigned, the
Administrator must follow these steps in Brand Registry:  

  1. Click **Manage** at the top of the page, then select **Manage selling accounts**.
  2. Find the merchant token that you want to edit, and click **Manage access**.
  3. Add or remove selling roles by checking or unchecking the boxes for each brand.

## Manage selling role requests

Once a selling partner submits a request for brand selling benefits, their
request will appear on the **Requests** tab of the Administrator’s **Manage
selling accounts** page. The Administrator will then be able to assign
permissions, at their discretion, to the user.

To add or decline selling role requests, the Administrator must follow these
steps in Brand Registry:  

  1. Click **Manage** at the top of the page, then select **Manage selling accounts**.
  2. Click the **Requests** tab.
  3. Accept or reject each of the requests.

(English only).

## Request selling roles

If you are an Amazon seller that sells the products of a registered brand, you
can request a selling role. This role will define your relationship to the
brand, either as a Brand Representative or Reseller. These roles grant
different access and privileges. You can learn the distinctions between these
roles in the above “Available selling roles” section.

To request the Brand Representative role, follow these steps in Seller
Central:  

  1. Go to the main menu and select **Brands** , then **Build your brand**. 
  2. On the **Brand benefit eligibility** page, click **View registered brands** to see the list of the brands that you sell in the Amazon store. 
  3. Click **Identify as the brand owner** next to the brand that you would like connect. Then, in the pop-up window, click **Submit request**.

If you don’t have access to the **Brand benefit eligibility** page, you can
still request the Brand Representative role by contacting the registered
brand’s Administrator directly.

To request the Reseller role, contact the brand Administrator.

**Note:** We do not share Administrator contact information.

Once the Administrator grants you the Brand Representative or Reseller role,
you will receive an invitation from the brand via email. You will become
eligible to access related benefits within 48 hours.

If you are a vendor, you must contact your vendor manager to request a selling
role.

For more information, watch [Request access to brand selling
benefits](https://d19kyknqbexfz7.cloudfront.net/US/2023-Q4/US_EN_Request_access_to_brand_selling_benefits.1.5.2023.mp4)
(English only).

**Note:** If you are currently assigned a selling role and no longer want to
be associated with the brand, you must contact the Administrator directly and
ask to be removed. If you are unable to contact the Administrator, you can
contact Selling Partner Support to help you through the process of being
removed from the brand.
