Success in business depends upon setting goals, it is a powerful way to ensure
your business stays on track. By setting clear, actionable goals, you can
focus your efforts on what matters most and measure your success over time.

**Note:** The Business Planner is in early release. You can currently set only
recommended goals, but we’re working to add new goal types and more
flexibility based on user feedback

**Here are ways to set a goal in Business Planner:**

  * **navigate to the goals section**
    * Sign in to your Seller Central account.
    * On your homepage, look for Business Planner card in the recommendations section. Select the card to access Business Planner. 
  * **review preset goals**
    * Review recommended goals.
    * Select each goal to see more details. Take/create the goal to explore action plans.
  * **select and customize goals**
    * Review targets, timeline and if available set constraints for the goal.
    * You will be able to further customize this later.
  * **create the action plan automatically**
    * Each goal comes with a detailed action plan, outlining the steps required to achieve it. These tasks are designed to be specific, measurable, achievable and relevant to you and your business.
    * Review the tasks listed under each goal and complete these as you see fit.
  * **monitor progress over time**
    * In the associated page of each goal, you can monitor your current progress toward your goal from when you began, to your target line.
    * We recommend checking your progress at least once a month while completing your actions

**Note:**

A Business Planner is a dynamic tool updated to highlight opportunities for
business goals. All actions and features across Seller Central are documented
with the planner. Our recommendations will evolve as our models improve.

The goal targets in the Planner are recommendations for sellers. We recognize
that the external factors beyond our control may affect overall business
growth. Therefore, we can’t guarantee that any specific targets will be active
within a set timeframe.

You can view the information in Business Planner as directional guidance. This
action will help you to rely on your own business expertise and take decision
for your selling operations.
