## Overview

We have improved the product listing experience allowing you to customize your
templates to list products from different categories together in one template.

If you previously used the Category specific and Book Loader templates, you
will need to begin using the new Custom and Category Custom templates. Amazon
will no longer accept older versions for creating or modifying listings. If
you submit an old template, you will receive an error in your **Processing
Report**. On the **Monitor Upload Status** tab within the **Add Products via
Upload** page, you can download your previously submitted data in the newer
version by clicking on the **Download your submission in the updated
template** version beside your upload status.

**Note:** Inventory Loader, Listing Loader, and Price and Quantity templates
will not be affected by this change.

The new templates are in an Excel format, and are regularly updated with the
current listing requirements for Amazon. This ensures you are able to provide
all of the current required and optional information for each category and use
new features. There are two options for using the new templates:  

  1. Custom templates
     * These are customizable templates that you can tailor by selecting the categories and attribute groups you need. All the selected categories are auto populated as a drop-down selection in the new template. To learn more about Custom templates, see the [Create your inventory file template](/gp/help/G202094740) page.
  2. Category Custom templates
     * These are the updated version of the Category specific inventory files featuring the full list of attributes for an entire category.
     * See the [Inventory file templates and BTG](/gp/help/G1641) page to download the templates.

## Attributes and valid values

The new templates include new attributes and required fields. Attributes in
the Custom template are generated based on the chosen category through the
Product Classifier tool.

In addition, minor changes were made to the valid value options since Amazon
periodically revises values to ensure relevant and correct values are being
shown.
