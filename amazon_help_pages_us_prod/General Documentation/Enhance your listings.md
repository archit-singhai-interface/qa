Customers search and browse on Amazon using specific product details. To
improve your product discoverability and conversion, you must ensure that the
listing information is correct and complete. The Listing Enhancements tool
provides views by adding essential product information to your listing.

Automatically detected enhancement opportunities are shown in your Seller
Central account under in the [Listing Enhancements](/inventory?viewId=DEFECT&)
section.

For additional information, go to [Product Listing
Guidelines](/gp/help/G202073140) and [Condition
guidelines](/gp/help/G200339950). Reviewing and complying with these
guidelines will help you keep your account in good health.

## Enhance listings in bulk from Manage Inventory

**Note:** If you use feeds to add or edit your product listings, you can still
use the [Listing
Enhancements](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/inventory?viewId=DEFECT) tool
to make changes. However, you must also update your feed files. If you do not
update your feed files, subsequent feeds can overwrite any changes you submit
through the Listing Enhancements tool. We suggest that when submitting feeds
to edit your listings, set the **update_delete** column to **PartialUpdate**
and provide values only for the column that you wish to update. This will help
to avoid overwriting changes made through the Listing Enhancements tool.

  

  1. Under **Inventory** , select **Manage All Inventory**.
  2. Select **Listing Enhancements** in the horizontal menu.

**Note:** The **Listing Enhancements** feature is visible only if there are
any identified enhancement opportunities. If no enhancement opportunities are
available, this link will not be visible to you.

  3. View all the enhancements on the main **Listing Enhancements** page, or click **Enhancement type** to filter by specific type of listing enhancement opportunity.
  4. There are 3 ways to enhance your listings:   

    1. Enter missing information in the **Enhancement** column using the editable cells or drop-downs, and click **Save**.
    2. Enter missing information in bulk by selecting multiple products that require the same enhancement. Click **Enhance "n" Listings** , where "n" stands for the number of selected products. Then, submit a value in the **Enhance multiple listings** pop-up field.
    3. Enter missing information for products that are not available in the editable grid (Option a) or in bulk (Option b) by clicking **Edit** and navigating to **Edit Product Info** page. In **Edit Product Info** , the missing details will be highlighted. 

In the Clothing, Accessories & Luggage, Sporting Goods, and Beauty categories,
display elements such as product title, bullet points, and description are
populated from the parent ASIN instead of child ASINs. If this is a child ASIN
and you would like to see it reflecting different information, you will have
to make updates to the parent ASIN instead. For more information, go to [How
variations appear on product detail pages](/gp/help/G202135360).
