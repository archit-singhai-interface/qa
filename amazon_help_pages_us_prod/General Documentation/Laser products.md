If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## Laser products covered by this policy

Generally, all laser products, regardless of their hazard class, must be
certified and reported to the FDA before being imported to the US.

**Laser pointers**

Laser pointers are typically a pen-shaped pointing device (usually powered by
a battery) that contains a small diode laser that emits an intense beam of
light. Handheld laser pet toys and 303s are high powered variations of laser
pointers.

**Laser presentation remotes**

Presentation remotes are typically a remote-control device primarily used to
control visual aids, such as a slide deck, in a group presentation. A low-
powered laser pointer has been incorporated as an ancillary feature to direct
attention during a presentation.

**Non-handheld laser pet toys**

Non-handheld laser pet toys are free-standing devices and can have a pet-
themed shape. They should not have a pen shape. The laser beam provides
stimulation to pets.

**Children’s toys with lasers**

Applications of lasers in children's toys can vary widely. Common uses of
lasers in children's toys are toy guns with laser range finders, spinning tops
with spinning lights, laser light sabers, and toys which use lasers to create
optical effects in a room. The FDA recommends that children's toys that
incorporate lasers have a safety limit of hazard class I (1 mW output).

**Laser light shows and stage lighting**

Laser lighting displays, also known as laser light shows or stage lights, are
a product that involves the use of laser lights to entertain an audience.
These laser beams are often projected and are generally incorporated into
entertainment performances. The lasers used in these shows are regulated by
the FDA and are often high-powered beams of light. The lasers used in these
products can cause damage to eyes and skin if exposure to the beam occurs.

**Garden laser projectors**

Garden laser projectors are typically used for seasonal lighting effects,
garden laser projectors and outdoor laser lighting have diffraction gratings
to split a laser beam into numerous dots of light onto the projected surface
which may move and change colors. These systems are weatherproof and come in a
special outdoor housing.

**Infrared illumination lasers for surveillance and security equipment**

Infrared (IR) lasers are capable of emitting intense light for long distances
and are often used for long-range distance illumination for night-vision
cameras, security systems, and project light beams with a wavelength of 810
nm.

Below are the four major laser hazard classes (I to IV) and three subclasses
(IIa, IIIa and IIIb):

Class FDA (Food and Drug Administration) | Class IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) | Hazards | Examples  
---|---|---|---  
I | 1, 1M | Considered non-hazardous. Hazard increases if viewed with optical aids, including magnifiers, binoculars, or telescopes. | 

  * Laser printers
  * CD players
  * DVD players

  
IIa, II | 2, 2M | Hazard increases when viewed directly for long periods of time. Hazard increases if viewed with optical aids. | 

  * Bar code scanners

  
IIIa | 3R | Depending on power and beam area, can be momentarily hazardous when directly viewed or when staring directly at the beam with an unaided eye. Risk of injury increases when viewed with optical aids. | 

  * Laser pointers

  
IIIb | 3B | Immediate skin hazard from direct beam and immediate eye hazard when viewed directly. | 

  * Laser light show projectors
  * Industrial lasers
  * Research lasers

  
IV | 4 | Immediate skin hazard and eye hazard from exposure to either the direct or reflected beam; may also present a fire hazard. | 

  * Laser light show projectors
  * Industrial lasers
  * Research lasers
  * Medical device lasers for eye surgery or skin treatments

  
  
## Our policy for laser products

**Products that you can’t sell under our policy**

Customers have to be confident that they’ll find a selection of safe,
reliable, and compliant products on Amazon. We don’t allow the listing or sale
of non-compliant or prohibited products.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

  * 303s lasers
  * Applications of lasers in children's toys exceeding hazard class I (1, 1M)
  * Hand held pet lasers
  * Surveying, leveling, alignment and demonstration laser products in Class IIIb (3B) and Class IV (4) without variance

For more information about prohibited products, go to [Product safety listing
restrictions](/help/hub/reference/external/GRLKLZ6WQ9R259LC).

**Products that you can sell under our policy**

Amazon requires that all other laser products have been tested to and comply
with the regulations, standards, and requirements listed below:

Product | Regulations, standards, and requirements  
---|---  
Laser pointers |  One of the following two options:

  * 21 CFR 1040.10 (Performance Standards for Light-Emitting Products - Laser products) **and** 21 CFR 1040.11 (Specific purpose laser products)
  * IEC 60825-1 (Safety of laser products - Part 1: Equipment classification and requirements)

  
Laser presentation remotes  
Non-handheld laser pet toys  
Children's toys with lasers  
Laser light shows and stage lighting  
Garden laser projectors  
Infrared illumination lasers for surveillance and security equipment  
  
**Your detail page must contain the following information:**

  * Model, part, or item number
  * Manufacturer or brand name

**You must submit the following:**

**Documents:**

  * Either an official Food and Drug Administration (FDA) email or acknowledgment letter containing of the product’s accession number
  * Test reports from either a nationally recognized testing laboratory (NRTL) or an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory that shows that the product complies with the regulations, standards, and requirements listed above. The document must demonstrate that the entire product as a whole is compliant, not just the component.

**Images:**

  * Model, part or item number
  * Name and address of manufacturer, importer, distributor or authorized representative
  * Product labels
  * Product packaging
  * Hazard warnings (Class 1 Optional)
  * Product instructions and manuals

**Note:** All documents, test reports, or certificates provided to Amazon must
be authentic and in their original (unmodified) format.

**When you submit images or documentation with images, ensure the following:**

  * Images are clear and legible
  * Images demonstrate that the product is the same as the product tested and listed on the product detail page
  * Product instructions, manuals, safety information, labels, and warnings are in the language of the intended country of sale
  * If the product is a set or bundle, provide images for each product included

**Note:** Where possible, provide images of all sides of a product or its
packaging to help ensure that the requirements are met and reduce the
possibility of delays in the approval process.

Customer safety is our top priority. We reserve the right to ask for
additional information to verify product safety and compliance at any time.
