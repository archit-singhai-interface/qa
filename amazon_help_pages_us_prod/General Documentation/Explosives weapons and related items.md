**Important:** If you supply products for sale on Amazon, you must comply with
all federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to those
products and product listings.

Our policy is that you must comply with all applicable federal laws when
selling weapons, imitation weapons, and weapon accessories.

You must also comply with state and local laws applicable to the jurisdiction
into which your products are sold, as well as the jurisdiction from which you
ship. For example, many state laws place requirements on size, color, and
markings of imitation weapons.

In addition, you are responsible for obtaining any required licenses for
permitted products and are liable for any penalties that result from non-
compliance.

If you use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), go to [FBA prohibited
