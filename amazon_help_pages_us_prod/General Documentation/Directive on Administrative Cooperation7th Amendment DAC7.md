## Introduction to DAC7

The Directive on Administrative Cooperation – 7th amendment (DAC7) is an EU
directive (EU Council Directive 2021/514) that requires online stores that
facilitate sales to sellers who have their primary address in the EU to
collect, verify and report sellers’ information and financial data to the
competent authorities.

To comply with DAC7, Amazon must perform the following actions:

  

  1. Collect additional information such as tax identification numbers (TINs), for individuals or business registration number (BRNs) for entities, company registration numbers, and permanent establishments, from affected sellers.
  2. Verify the information, including verification against the respective authorities databases.
  3. Report sellers data along with details on the consideration earned, the fees charged to them and banking details. 
  4. If the necessary information is not provided within 60 days from your first [performance notification](/performance/notifications) Amazon is required to deactivate non-compliant accounts until this information is submitted and verified.

## Am I impacted?

You are impacted if you meet both of the following criteria:

  * Established in any EU country, regardless of the store you are selling in;
  * Generate €2,000 or more on sales or have completed 30 or more transactions within the current or any following calendar year. 

## What should I do if I am impacted?

To comply with DAC7 obligations, you will be required to take the following
actions:

  

  1. Add the necessary information in the [Legislation Compliance DAC7 portal](/complianceportal?ref=DAC7_hp_D7port). We suggest you to comply with the regulation as soon as possible. You’ll be granted 60 days after receiving the first notification from Amazon to comply
  2. Reconfirm the data and declarations every 36 months or every time you proactively make changes to any of the data points in the same portal. 

**Note:****You must add this information in every store that you’re active
in**. The EU is considered as one single store (DE, FR, IT, ES, NL, UK, SE,
PL, BE, IE), so if you are only selling in EU countries, you will be required
to complete this action only once in the EU store of your choice. If you’re
selling in EU stores as well as other stores (TR, JP, AU, SG, IN, UAE, EG,
KSA, CA, US, MX, BR) you will be required to complete this action in one EU
store of your choice and in any other extra-EU store where you active listing.

Once submitted, Amazon will verify the information. The validation process can
take up to 30 days. You’ll be notified once the validation is complete. In
case your information has been rejected, you can re-submit the correct
information.

## What information must I provide to Amazon?

The required information to provide differs depending on whether you do
business as an entity or as an individual. Refer to the table below to
understand what might be required from you:

**Data point** | **Entities** | **Individuals**  
---|---|---  
First name and last name |  | x  
Company legal name | x |   
Primary address | x | x  
Any TIN issued, plus each member state of issuance | x | x  
VAT identification / registration number _(where available)_ * | x | x  
Date of birth |  | x  
Place of birth (only in absence of a TIN) |  | x  
Company registration number | x |   
Any permanent establishments through which relevant activities are carried out in the EU other than your primary address _(where available)_ | x |   
  
_*You must submit the VAT issued in country of Primary Address. If not
available, then the VAT for any other Member State. And, if that is not
available either, you must declare that you do not have any EU VAT in the
dedicated portal._

**Note:** An "entity" is a legal person or a legal arrangement, such as a
corporation, business relationship, trust, or foundation, while an
"individual" is a seller who is not an entity.

## What is a TIN?

TIN (Tax Identification Number) is a unique set of numbers that identifies
individuals. If you’re an Entity the equivalent number will be the Business
Registration Number (BRN). TIN format varies between EU countries. Go to

successful within 60 days of receiving the first notice from Amazon, your non-
compliant accounts will be deactivated and your funds will be withheld
accordingly until this information is provided and verified.

## DAC7 frequently asked questions

#### Is DAC7 a new tax?

No. DAC7is an EU directive (EU Council Directive 2021/514) is a set of
transparency rules that will apply to all digital operators (such as Amazon).

#### Is this a one-off or ongoing reporting obligation?

As of January 1, 2023, DAC7 is a reporting requirement on an annual basis. It
is your responsibility to update DAC7 information every 36 months or every
time you perform a change in the data-point mentioned.

#### My primary address is in the EU but I only sell outside of the EU. Am I
affected?

Yes. DAC7 affects sellers with a primary address in the EU, irrespective of
the store that they sell in.

For example, a seller with a primary address in Italy who only sells on
amazon.com (United States) will be affected.

#### My primary address is in Germany and I am active in the France, Spain,

times?

and Mexico stores. How many times must I add the necessary information?

You must add the required information twice, once in your Mexico Seller
Central account and once in the EU store of your choice.

As an example, if you only add the information for the EU but not for Mexico,
your Mexico account would be non-compliant. Your non-compliant account in
Mexico would then be deactivated and funds would be withheld accordingly.
