All sellers participating in the Subscribe with Amazon program should adhere
to the following policies when listing Products on Amazon.

Not all products are supported by the Subscribe with Amazon program at this
time. Currently, only products that are digital or cloud-based subscription
services can be sold via the Subscribe with Amazon program. Detailed
information on other restrictions can be found in the [Restricted Products
Guidelines](/gp/help/202073160).

If you have an eligible product, before the product can be sold via the
Subscribe with Amazon program, you need to create a Product Listing. To do so,
you need to provide the "Required Product Information" including the
following:

  * Product name
  * Product category
  * Length(s) of subscription (time period and/or number of deliveries during a subscription period)
  * Purchase Price 
  * SKU and UPC/EAN/JAN numbers, and other identifying information as Amazon may reasonably request
  * Compatible devices
  * Supported login types
  * Information regarding availability
  * Digitized image that accurately depicts only your Product and does not include any additional logos, text or other markings
  * Any text, disclaimers, warnings, notices, labels or other content required by applicable Law to be displayed in connection with the offer, merchandising, advertising or sale of your Product
  * Link to your website, and
  * Link to your privacy policy and any other terms and conditions applicable to the product that a customer should be aware of prior to purchasing the product.

If your product is a subscription service that will automatically renew, your
product listing must also clearly and conspicuously display to customers the
following information:

  * Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current term
  * Account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current term
  * The term and cost of the renewal, and
  * Subscriptions may be managed by the customer and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the customer's subscription settings after the transaction is completed.

When you create a product listing, you agree to the following rules and
restrictions:

  * The information regarding your products that you provide to us is of at least the same level of quality as the highest quality information displayed or used in seller sales channels
  * The use of false product identification information in product listings is prohibited
  * A single detail page may only advertise one product; listing multiple products on a detail page is prohibited.
  * Product Listings may not feature or contain any of the items designated as "Restricted Products" by Amazon
  * You may not include any of the following information in Product Listing page titles, descriptions, bullet points, or images is prohibited: 
    * Pornographic, obscene, or offensive content
    * Phone numbers, physical mail addresses, e-mail addresses, or website URLs (except for the specific URLs requested as part of the Required Product Information)
    * Alternative ordering information (such as links to other websites for placing orders)
    * Reviews, quotes, or testimonials
    * Solicitations for positive customer reviews
    * Advertisements, promotional material, or watermarks on images, photos, or videos, and
    * Time-sensitive information (i.e., dates of promotional tours, seminars, lectures, etc.)
  * All Product images must meet Amazon image standards, and
  * You may not use bad data (HTML, special characters */? etc.) in titles, descriptions, bullets and for any other attribute
