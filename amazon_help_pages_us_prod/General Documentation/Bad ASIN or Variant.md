An image will fail to upload if the file name cannot be associated with an
ASIN or variant.  
  
Some of the reasons we may reject an image are:

  * The system did not recognize the ASIN (10-digit Amazon product identifier) or variant.
  * The EAN/UPC/10 or 13-digit ISBN/JAN/GTIN does not belong to an ASIN.
  * Your ASIN was not yet set up in our system for these external IDs to map.
