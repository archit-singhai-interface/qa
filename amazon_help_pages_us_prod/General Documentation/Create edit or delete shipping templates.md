templates for specific groups of SKUs.

## Create a new shipping template

  2. On the **Shipping Templates** tab, click **Create New Shipping Template** , or choose an option under **No, I want to copy the content from**.

  3. Click **OK**.

  4. Enter the template name (for example, "Free Shipping").

  5. Choose the [rate model](/gp/help/201841310) for your shipping rates: **Per item/weight-based** , **Price banded** or **Weight-tiered** (only available to [freight shipping template](/gp/help/G202188040)).

  6. Enable or disable **Prime delivery** as needed.

  7. Select or deselect **Same day** for **Handling Time Settings**. Refer to [Same-day handling](/gp/help/GLL8GJCFS23K333Q) for more information.

multiple rules for the same shipping option to customize the settings by
region.
