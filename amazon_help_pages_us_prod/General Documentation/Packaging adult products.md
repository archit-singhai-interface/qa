**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

Adult products must be bagged for protection in black, opaque bags. The
outside of the bag must have a scannable ASIN and a suffocation warning. This
includes but is not limited to products that meet any of the following
requirements:

  * Products that contain pictures of live, nude models
  * Packaging with obscene or profane messaging
  * Items that are themselves life‐like in nature but with no live‐model nudity shown

## Acceptable adult product packaging

  * Tame, abstract products that are not life‐like in nature
  * Plain packaging without models
  * Plain packaging where models are not in suggestive or compromising positions
  * Packaging with no obscene text
  * Suggestive text but no profanity
