**Important:** When you sell on Amazon, you must follow federal, state, and
local laws, and Amazon policies that apply to your products and listings.

To maintain a safe and trustworthy shopping experience, certain products
cannot be listed or sold on Amazon or may be subject to additional
requirements because they have legal or regulatory restrictions (for example,
illegal drugs) or violate other Amazon policies (for example, crime scene
photos). Please review these pages in detail to understand what policies or
approval requirements may apply to your products before listing them for sale.
