FBA provides repackaging and refurbishment services for items in which the
packaging is damaged but the item is otherwise sellable. Repackaging is
automatic for eligible items, while refurbishment is an optional service.

## Repackaging services

FBA repackages your eligible customer returns so that they can be sold as new.
The service applies both to retail and FBA return items, and cannot be
disabled in your settings.

Each returned unit is evaluated to determine whether it can be repackaged.
Repackaging can include replacing the poly bag or bubble wrapping, or re-
boxing the item. It can also include repackaging of branded and unbranded
boxes, and poly bags.

## Refurbishment services

Additional packaging services are available through optional refurbishment.
Depending on the item, FBA can re-tape, re-glue, and re-staple boxes; remove
excessive tape, non-product labels, and stickers; and re-box branded and
unbranded corrugated boxes. Shoes and apparel refurbishment can include
steaming and removing stains and odors.

You can change your [refurbishment settings](/gp/ssof/configuration/refurbish-
settings.html) at any time.
