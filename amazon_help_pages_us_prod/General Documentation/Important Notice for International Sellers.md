If you register to sell on Amazon.com from a country outside of the United
States, there are important steps you must take before you begin selling. The
following steps ensure a great experience for you and for customers:

Currently, we support bank accounts in Australia (AUD), Canada (CAD), Eurozone (EUR), Hong Kong (HKD), India (INR), New Zealand (NZD), United Kingdom (GBP) and United States (USD). The Eurozone includes the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.
  * You must accurately state the 'shipping from' country in your Amazon.com seller profile for display to customers. 
  * You will be responsible for assuring that you will meet the shipping expectations for all orders you receive.
  * Products must be listed in U.S. dollars.
  * All customer facing content and communications must be in American (U.S.) English. 
  * You should understand the laws that apply to you as a seller on our website and only list, sell, and export products that comply with those laws.
