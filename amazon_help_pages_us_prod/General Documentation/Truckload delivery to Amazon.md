Less than truckload (LTL) and full truckload (FTL) shipments, including
wrapped pallets, require additional preparations. Here is everything you and
your carrier are responsible for when sending large volume shipments to
Amazon.

**Note:** The requirements for individual boxes shipped to fulfillment centers
also apply to boxes loaded on pallets for transport by truck. For more
information see [Shipping and routing requirements](/gp/help/200141510).

## What you must do

You are responsible for:

  * Using acceptable pallets
  * Building pallet shipments
  * Adhering to pallet label requirements
  * Providing the bill of lading (BOL)
  * Providing your carrier with Amazon reference IDs, shipment IDs, and tracking (PRO) numbers
  * Applying the seals to FTL and intermodal trailers and providing the seal number on BOL. 

For more information, see [Seller requirements for LTL, FTL and FCL
deliveries](/gp/help/200978400).

## What your carrier needs to do

Make sure your carrier:

  * Has Amazon reference IDs, shipment IDs, and tracking (PRO) numbers
  * Schedules delivery appointments in advance for the expected shipment(s)
  * Adheres to the vehicle condition requirements

For more information, see [Carrier requirements for less than truckload (LTL)
and full truckload (FTL) deliveries](/gp/help/200978420).

**Note:** Carriers should only request advanced appointments once all
shipments that will be physically delivered have been determined. You can only
request up to 3 appointments for a single shipment.

**Important:** Multiple appointments for the same physical delivery or
providing incorrect shipment information may cause appointments to be deleted
and delay your shipment. For more information, see the “Dos & Don’ts” section
on the [Carrier Central user manual](https://images-na.ssl-images-

##  Label Boxes

  * Print the full set of labels. Because each label is unique, do not photocopy, reuse, or modify labels for use on additional boxes. 
  * All boxes must have shipment labels, and shipment labels must not include other messaging. If you are reusing boxes from previous shipments, be sure to remove or cover any other shipment labels, barcodes, or markings. 
  * Shipment labels must be consistently placed in a way that is easy to see on side of the box. Side placement is preferred.
  * Do not place shipment labels on the seam of the box where they could be damaged when the box is opened, making the barcodes unscannable. 
  * Whenever possible, place shipment labels no closer than 1.25 inches from any edge of the box. The tape used to seal the box should not cover the shipment labels.

##  Additional Requirements for Amazon Partnered Shipments

If you are using one of Amazon's partnered carriers, you must enter accurate
dimensional data for your pallets. These dimensions are used to calculate your
freight class, which is used to provide an estimated shipping charge.

For more information, see [Amazon Partnered Carrier
options.](/gp/help/201119120)

**Note:** Your actual shipping charges may be higher than the amount we
estimate when you create a shipment for the Partnered LTL/FTL program if the
carrier determines that your pallets weigh more than you indicated or that the
freight class you provided is incorrect.

**Note:** Accurate box weight and dimensions are required for all shipments,
even if you opt to not provide box content information in Seller Central.

Learn more about [weight and measurement requirements](/gp/help/201105770).

## Additional resources and requirements

Pallets are required for shipments sent with an Amazon Partnered carrier.
Pallets are preferred for non-partnered carriers as well, but if you must
floor load your shipment, see [Floor loading policy](/gp/help/200978440).

For units packed in boxes that are individually labeled for delivery by parcel
carriers (UPS, DHL, FedEX, or local partner services), see [Small parcel
delivery to Amazon](/gp/help/200280260).
