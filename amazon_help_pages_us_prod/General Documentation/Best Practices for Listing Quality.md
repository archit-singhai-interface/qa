To create a high-quality detail page, you need the product title, images,
brand, description, and bulleted lists. This information can help a detail
page display higher in search results, which increases the likelihood of
product discoverability or customer clicks. We have created category style
guides, which contain guidelines for images, descriptions, and so on. We used
PDF format for your ease of downloading and printing. Review the [Amazon
Services Quick Start Style Guide](https://m.media-
amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/help/Selling_on_Amazon_Quick_Start_Style_Guide_2018.pdf)
to learn the basic style guidelines that apply to all categories.

See the following best practices for each field.

  * **Product titles** should be created using guidelines for the category
  * **Images** should accurately represent the product and show only the product for sale; images should have a white background and fill at least 85% of the image space
  * **Description and bullet points** should contain detailed information about the features and usage of the product as well as highlight specific product information not located elsewhere on the page

## Product Title

The product title is one of the main fields used by Amazon and search engines
to measure the relevancy of a detail page as part of a customer search. Titles
that are created according to the category perform better in product searches.
A customer is more likely to click on high-quality product titles in search
results to help them make a purchasing decision. The following table shows
high-quality listing compared to a low-quality listing.

## Image

Using a quality image is an important element that helps a customer choose one
search result over another. Images help the customer compare the features and
benefits of products. Multiple images enable the customer to see all angles of
the product, further enhancing their purchasing experience. The following
table shows an example of a low-quality listing compared to multiple images
for a high-quality listing.

## Desciption and Bullet Points

The description and bullet points are other fields used by Amazon and search
engines to measure the relevancy of a detail page as part of a customer
search.
