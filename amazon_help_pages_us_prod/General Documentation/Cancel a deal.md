You may cancel a proposed deal at any time. To avoid [paying a
fee](/gp/help/202111590) or being blocked from creating future deals, we
recommend that you cancel your deal at least 25 hours before the start time.
If you ever need to cancel your deal, do so before it becomes visible to
customers.

To cancel a deal:  

  1. From the [Deals dashboard](/merchandising), filter your deals by **Status** to show only deals that **Needs Attention** or are **Upcoming**. For the deals that you want to cancel, click the drop-down button next to **Edit**.
  2. Select **Cancel deal** from the menu.

**Note:** Deals can be canceled by you (seller) or by the system (Amazon). The
system will only cancel deals, if they violate Amazon policy.
