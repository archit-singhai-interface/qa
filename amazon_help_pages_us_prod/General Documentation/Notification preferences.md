Notification Preferences allow you to indicate how you want to receive
notifications and alerts about your seller account.

To set your notification preferences, follow these steps:

  1. From your seller account, select **Settings** , then select **Notification Preferences**. 

  2. On the **Notifications Options** tab, review your email settings.

  3. To update or add an email address, click the **Edit** button for each type of notification.

  4. Update or add your email address, select which notifications you wish to enable, and click **Save**.

**Note:** Leaving a box unselected means you will be opted out of receiving
future notifications.

If you are a global seller selling in multiple locales, you will need to
review/update preferences for each locale individually.

##  Email delivery failure

On your seller account home page, there is an alert box. This alert notifies
you of any delivery failures with your email notifications. Email delivery can
fail because your inbox is full or your internet service provider failed to
deliver the notification.

If you receive an alert, go to [Notification
Preferences](/gp/seller/configuration/notificationPreferences.html) to reset
your delivery preferences, and then follow up with your Internet service
provider for any technical issues.

##  Notification types

following list contains all of the available notification types, regardless of
the selling plan you have:
