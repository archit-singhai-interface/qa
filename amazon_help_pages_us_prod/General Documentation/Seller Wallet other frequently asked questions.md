#### What should I do if I’m not able to access my Seller Wallet account?

Once your registration for a Seller Wallet account has been processed, you can
access it by logging into your Seller Central account and selecting **Seller
Wallet** under the **Reports** drop-down menu.

If you’re not the primary user (also called point of contact), ensure that the
primary user has updated their user permissions to grant you access. All
authorized users must be verified before getting access to Seller Wallet.

circumstances.
