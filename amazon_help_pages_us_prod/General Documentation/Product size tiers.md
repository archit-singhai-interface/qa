For large standard, oversize (excluding special oversize), large bulky, and
extra-large (excluding 150+ lb), Amazon uses dimensional weight when it’s
greater than the unit weight to calculate fees. Fees for small standard,
special oversize, and extra-large 150+ lb are calculated using only unit
weight.
