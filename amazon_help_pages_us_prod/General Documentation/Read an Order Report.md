When an Order Report is ready, click the **Download** button and save the file
to your local hard drive. You can then open it in a database or spreadsheet
program, such as Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel.

There may be several rows for an individual order in your report. If all of
the order information does not fit in one row (such as when multiple
promotions are applied to an order), the information will be split over
multiple rows.

If you use Amazonâ€™s optional tax calculation services, item tax, gift wrap
tax, and shipping tax amounts will be shown in the Order Report. Additional
information regarding taxes collected can be found in the Sales Tax report in
the Tax Document Library.
