#### How do I find the transactional level details of my unadjusted gross
sales for a specific year?

You can use the Date Range Reports page to generate individual transaction
reports for a specific date range.

To generate a date range report, follow these steps:  

  1. Go to **Menu** drop-down and from the **Reports** section, select **Payments**.
  2. Select **Reports Repository**. You must generate a report for both Standard and Invoiced orders (if applicable).
  3. To generate a date range report, proceed as follows:  

    1. Select Account Type as **All (Unified Reports)**.
    2. Select report type: **Transaction**.
    3. Select reporting date range period: Month or Custom, and the specified date information.
    4. Click **Request Report.**
  4. Review your report in the list on the **Payments Reports** page.
  5. Filter the type column by **Order**.
  6. Add the total of Product Sales + Product Sales Tax + Shipping Credits + Shipping Credits Tax + Gift Wrap + Gift Wrap Tax + Promotional Rebates + Promotional Rebates Tax for both Standard & Invoiced orders (if applicable).

**Note:**

Reports can take up to one hour to generate. If you do not see your report in
the list, check again later.

If you are attempting to reconcile a previous yearsâ€™ Form 1099-K (2018 or
prior), be aware that the calculation in step 6 from above will include
Marketplace facilitator tax (if applicable).

#### The transactional level details in my date range reports do not match the
IRS Form 1099-K that I received.

The IRS Form 1099-K you received is reported based on the information you
provided during the US tax identity interview. The IRS Form 1099-K is
generated from your Selling on Amazon activity, Prime Now, Amazon Pay,
Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Flexible Payments Systems (FPS), plus Invoicing.

**Note:** Amazon is required to report based on the date of the shipment,
while the Date Range reports in your Seller Central account are based on the
date of the order. For invoicing, it is based on the date you received the
funds into your account. Due to this, you may see a difference in reported
amounts month over month, or an overlap between December and January of the
following tax year.

#### How do I find the summary level details of my unadjusted gross sales for
a specific year?

You can use the Date Range Reports page to generate summary reports for a
specific date range.

To generate a date range report, follow these steps:  

  1. Go to **Menu** drop-down and from the **Reports** section, select **Payments**.
  2. Select **Reports Repository**. You must generate a report for both Standard and Invoiced orders (if applicable).
  3. To generate a date range report, proceed as follows:  

    1. Select report type: **Summary**.
    2. Select reporting date range period: Month or Custom, and the specified date information.
    3. Click **Request Report.**
  4. Review your report in the list on the **Payments Reports** page.

**Note:** Reports can take up to one hour to generate. If you do not see your
report in the list yet, check again later.

  5. To calculate unadjusted gross sales, add the amounts in the report columns listed in the two charts below for both Standard and Invoiced orders (if applicable).
