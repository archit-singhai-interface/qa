Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fee is a flat fee per unit, based on the size and
weight of the product. Use the size tiers, to calculate the shipping weight
and fee that will be applied.

**Important:** Each year, Amazon reassess the FBA fees to reflect changes in
costs to fulfill, transport, and deliver products, and will continue to invest
in supply chain efficiencies.
