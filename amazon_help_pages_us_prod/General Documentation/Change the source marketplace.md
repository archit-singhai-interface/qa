You can change the source marketplace from which your target marketplaces are
synchronized by following these steps:

  

  1. Follow the steps in [Remove a connection using Build International Listings](/gp/help/202121660) to remove connections for all target marketplaces. This may take up to four hours for each marketplace from the time you made the request. You will get an email when each removal request is complete. 

**Tip:** To avoid processing errors, wait until all removal requests are
complete before you create new connections.

  2. Follow the steps to create a new connection in [Create a connection using Build International Listings](/gp/help/202121580), selecting the appropriate source marketplace.
