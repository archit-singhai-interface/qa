The USPS Shipment Confirmation Acceptance Notice (SCAN) form can be used to
consolidate the shipment details for USPS packages purchased using [Buy
Shipping](/gp/help/G200202220). USPS requires a SCAN form to scan packages at
the pickup location for a pickup of five or more packages.

Instead of requiring every single package to be scanned, you can use the USPS
SCAN form to update USPS with the tracking details of all your outgoing
shipments from a single form.

After you have completed printing USPS shipments for the day, follow the
instructions below to generate the USPS SCAN form.  

  1. Go to [Orders](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/order-reports-and-feeds/reports/ref=ag_orderrpt_dnav_xx_) and select **Order Reports**.
  2. Select the **End of day forms** tab.
  3. Choose the option **USPS** , select your relevant warehouse, and then press **Request.** The form will be available for download and print. 

**Note:** We will auto-generate a SCAN form for you to download for all
packages promised to be shipped at the end of each day.
