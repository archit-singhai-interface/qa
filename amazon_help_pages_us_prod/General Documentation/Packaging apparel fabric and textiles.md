Following the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) product packaging guidelines can
limit damage to your products, help make shipping costs more predictable, and
help ensure the best buyer experience.  
  
Cloth, fabric, and textiles can be damaged by dust or humidity. These products
must be packaged so that they are not damaged during receipt, stocking,
shipment preparation, or delivery to the customer. Place units in a sealed
poly bag, shrink wrap, or box. Regular-size hangers usually must be removed
(for more information, see **Hanger removal** on [Prepare your products for
FBA shipping](/gp/help/201021850)).
