## Service Order Types

  * **Pre-packaged Services** have a defined scope of work which allows Customers to purchase based on price estimates. For Offer-Based jobs, Pros enter their price estimates for each service they offer which Customers can then view on Amazon. These services can be identified on Amazon by the orange stripe on the service image. 
  * **Recurring Services** are a variation of Offer-Based jobs that Customers purchase as a subscription plan for recurring appointments. 

## How Pros Get Jobs

Pros can get new jobs in two different ways:

  * **Offer-Based Jobs** are purchased by Customers on Amazon by selecting a specific Pro and submitting three (3) appointment preferences. For these jobs, Pros set the price estimate upfront. Pros receive these jobs via email and work with the Customer to confirm a final appointment day and time.
  * [**Claim-based Jobs**](https://youtu.be/H_AgKCVyKP4) are first purchased by Customers on Amazon. Next, Amazon surfaces a single price using localized price estimates based on the range of competitive prices that providers offer for each service and collects a single appointment preference from the Customer. These jobs are then sent to all the Pros offering that service within the Customers ZIP code. Pros receive these jobs via notifications through the Selling Services on Amazon app or the Seller Central home page.
    * Claim-based jobs will have a limited review time to allow Pros to view job details and verify scheduling availability.
    * At the end of the review window, the job will be automatically assigned to the winning Pro based on a combination of factors meant to send the most business to Pros who consistently deliver against Amazonâ€™s service level requirements. If no Pro requests to claim the job during the review window, the job will be given to the first Pro who claims it.
