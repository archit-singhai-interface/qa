As part of our continued response to COVID-19, Amazon will continue to provide
customers with the supplies they need amidst the pandemic. These stores have
replaced COVID-19 supplies:

  * [COVID-19: Infection Control and Recovery](https://www.amazon.com/infectioncontrol) is intended for healthcare providers such as, hospitals, clinics, and physician practices and governments including states and local city management to easily source medical-related supplies and protective apparel such as, ventilators, N95 respirators, stethoscopes, and surgical gowns.
  * [PPE & Workplace safety essentials](https://www.amazon.com/healthywork) is intended for commercial companies, schools, and non-profits who need to protect their employees and customers amidst the pandemic. As these customers work to continue or reopen operations, we are offering in-demand workplace health supplies such as, cloth masks, hand sanitizer, traffic control, and thermometers.

#### What are the requirements to sell products in these stores?

Customer trust is our top priority. As such, we have implemented stringent
requirements to sell certain personal safety and household products to
customers seeking items related to the pandemic. These same requirements apply
to products listed in both of these stores. For more information, go to
[Categories and products that require approval](/gp/help/G200333160).

In addition, all N95 masks and internationally-manufactured equivalents such
as, KN95 masks, along with select ASINs in the product types listed below, are
subject to additional requirements to help ensure they meet the needs of
domestic healthcare, government and other front-line workers. We are not
currently accepting applications via Seller Central for these select ASINs.
However, sellers may sell other ASINs of the product types below if they meet
the applicable requirements:

  * Gowns
  * Hand sanitizers
  * Disinfectants
  * Medical gloves
  * Swabs
  * Digital thermometers

#### What customers can purchase these products?

Most of the products listed in these stores are available for purchase by any
Amazon customer, but some ASINs, including N95 masks, select ASINs of nitrile
gloves, and prescription-only products will only be available to eligible
customers, including healthcare and government organizations.

#### What selling fees apply to these products?

The [Selling on Amazon Fee Schedule](/gp/help/G200336920) applies to products
available on these two stores.
