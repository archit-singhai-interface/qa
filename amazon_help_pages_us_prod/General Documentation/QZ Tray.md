## What is QZ Tray?

QZ Tray is a third-party solution that enables One-Click printing. QZ Tray
One-Click printing is now integrated with Amazon Buy Shipping. In addition to
One-Click printing, this also solves print support for different formats and
current state printing issues with Print Connect. To learn about the benefits
of utilizing Buy Shipping, go to [Use Buy Shipping
services](/gp/help/200202220).

QZ Tray will allow you to:

  

  1. Print your shipping labels bought through Buy Shipping with one click
  2. Support different formats of shipping labels to specifically print PDF, ZPL or PNG
  3. Select your preferred printer and assign different printers to each format

## Why do you need QZ Tray?

The current state print solution, Print Connect, does not support multiple
formats. Therefore, additional steps are required to convert the label format
to a print-ready version. In addition, printing is a multi-step process, which
also results in issues if one or all of the steps fail. In order to make the
printing process seamless and effortless for sellers, we identified QZ Tray as
the best solution to enhance a seller's experience.

## Do I need to uninstall Print Connect to use QZ Tray?

If you are currently using Print Connect, you do not need to uninstall Print
Connect to install and use QZ Tray. However, all new sellers will be defaulted
to QZ Tray only. Amazon plans to eventually deprecate Print Connect. The
timelines for this deprecation are not decided yet.

## QZ Tray support

QZ Tray is a third-party solution that has been integrated with Amazon Buy
Shipping. This means there are some aspects of QZ Tray that are not directly
built and maintained by Amazon. However, we are committed to helping sellers
have the best experience with all the tools we implement, so if you are having
any trouble with QZ Tray, first refer to the troubleshooting and guidance
section on this help page. If your issue continues, then open a [Selling
Partner Support ticket](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/support).

**Note:** Some issues could take more time to resolve as we collaborate with
the QZ Tray team.

For any other issues related to label printing and Buy Shipping features,
reach out to Amazon Selling Partner Support. For more information, view the
troubleshooting section or go to [Use Buy Shipping
services](/gp/help/200202220).

To ensure our support team can assist you, we recommend gathering the

you have to connect your printer to the QZ Tray software. Below are the steps
for printer setup.

  1. Return to the Buy Shipping page after installing QZ Tray. You will notice the **One-Click-Printer** option is enabled with a default setting of “None”, indicating that you still haven’t selected a printer

**Note:** If you are not seeing the One-Click Printer dropdown, refresh the
web page and it should appear.

  2. Click the **One-Click-Printer** dropdown to select from your connected printers

  3. When QZ Tray is still trying to connect, it will show **Searching for Printers** in the dropdown.

  4. In order to configure printer preferences (such as default printer for all label printing), follow the steps below:    

    1. Go to **Printer Preferences** at the bottom of the Buy Shipping page 
    2. A pop-up with printer preferences for each type of label format will appear with default setting of “None” for each label format
    3. Select your preferred printer from all the connected printers present in each type of label format dropdown
    4. Now you will see your selected preferences in the **One-Click-Printer** dropdown

## Label print orientation

Label orientation may be different for different carriers. In some cases,
carrier label orientation is not present with Buy Shipping. You can select
from the predefined label orientation, but you cannot customize orientation of
such labels using QZ Tray on Buy Shipping. In order to change the printing
orientation of the label:

  1. On the Buy Shipping page, **select the carrier** you will use

  2. Click **Label print orientation** to choose a different layout from the predetermined options

  3. If you would like to further customize the label print orientation, choose **None** in the **One-Click-Printer** dropdown, and then click Buy Shipping. Once the label opens, you can configure your printing orientation without QZ Tray.

## QZ Tray: Troubleshooting

Note that for all existing sellers, that have Print Connect installed, Print
Connect will continue to be a default option. That is, in case of any QZ Tray
issues, the system will default to Print Connect (if installed) or normal
printing (if Print Connect is not installed) to allow sellers to continue with
the Label Printing feature.
