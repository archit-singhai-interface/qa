These Terms and Conditions ("**Terms and Conditions** ") apply to your
participation in the Global Selling Incentives program ("**Global Selling
Incentives** " or "**program** "). These Terms and Conditions supplement the
[Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement](/gp/help/G1791) (the
"**Agreement** ").

  * This program is only available to invited sellers who have received an offer directly from Amazon via email, on the [Seller benefits](/sellerbenefits/home) page, or the [Marketplace product guidance](/selection/cross-listing) page. The active offer will state the form of the incentives, the amount of the incentives in local currency, and when the offer expires. 
  * An incentive can only be used for the specified stores or products identified in the active offer. 
  * To receive the incentive, you must complete the eligibility steps outlined in the active offer within the time specified.
  * Upon your completion of the eligibility steps, the incentives stated in the offer will be added to your seller account. Any unused incentive amounts will expire one year after they are deposited in your seller account.
  * The incentives provided are non-transferable, not for resale, and not redeemable for cash.
  * If you violate any of these Terms and Conditions or the Amazon Business Services Agreement, the offer will be invalid. Amazon may void any unused incentives and reverse any incentives that were applied to your account as part of this program.
  * Amazon may terminate or modify these Terms and Conditions, change or cancel existing program incentives, or cancel your participation in the program at any time.
