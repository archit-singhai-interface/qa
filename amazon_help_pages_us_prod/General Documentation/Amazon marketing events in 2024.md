Effectively engage with your customers during key events throughout the year
by using the [2024 marketing calendar](https://m.media-
amazon.com/images/G/31/rainer/FINAL_2.22_2024_Marketing_Calendar-2.pdf). This
calendar is a guide that outlines relevant Amazon events for your business
that align with your deals strategies, advertising campaigns, and seasonal
content. Review the calendar and tips below to plan ahead to optimize for
success and delight your customers.

  * **Inventory preparedness** : Ensure your top-selling products are in stock and available to purchase during key events by having a minimum of five units and Prime shipping offers to deliver a positive customer experience.
  * **Listing optimization** : Enhance your product listings with bullet points, relevant keywords, captivating lifestyle imagery, and videos to improve customer understanding of your products.
  * **Seasonal content** : Refresh your A+ Content and brand storefront to engage customers with timely and relevant information.
  * **Deals participation** : Navigate to the **Deals** tab in Seller Central and create event-specific deals. Delight customers by creating deals of 20% or more for the event you choose to participate in. Not required, but highly recommended. Deals typically refresh weekly, so don't delay setup.
  * **Start advertising** : Invest in advertising campaigns to accelerate customer awareness, engagement, and conversion. Ramping advertising 1-2 weeks before, during, and a few days after the event helps maximize the traffic halo-effect generated from the event.

Explore the **Growth** and **Advertising** tabs within Seller Central
frequently to identify recommendations you can consider implementing to help
increase discoverability and growth for your brand and products.
