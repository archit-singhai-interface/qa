##  About Happiness Guarantee claims

Customer satisfaction is our number one priority, and the Happiness Guarantee
is one way that we help ensure a positive customer experience. Happiness
Guarantee customer claims are designed to handle situations in which a
customer is dissatisfied with the service provided.

In the event that a service does not proceed as planned from the customer’s
point of view, a Happiness Guarantee claim allows Amazon to find an acceptable
and timely resolution for both the customer and the service provider.

For more information, review the **Types of Happiness Guarantee claims**
section below.

A customer can bring a Happiness Guarantee claim if it meets each of the
following criteria:

  * They purchased the service in the Amazon.com store.
  * They are not satisfied with the work (note that documentation is required to process the claim, from both the service provider and the customer).
  * The scope of work was limited to the description of the services listed in the Amazon.com store or was changed through Amazon’s systems (for example, an agreed upon change order).
  * The service was completed within the last 90 days.

## Types of Happiness Guarantee claims

Happiness Guarantee claims are classified by the reason for the
dissatisfaction. Here are some common reasons:

  * **Property damage** : Happens when property is damaged during or due to the service.
  * **Damaged products** : Applies when a service involved a device, appliance, or similar item and such item was damaged during completion of the service.
  * **Service quality** : Is when a service was completed; however, the customer is dissatisfied with the way the service was completed.
