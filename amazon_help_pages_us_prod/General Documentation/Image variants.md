Images displayed on the product detail page feature a main image that is shown
in search results and is the first image displayed on the page. Additional
images are called **Image variants,** which show the product in use or in an
environment, and display different angles and even product features.

We recommend that you provide at least six clear, informative, and attractive
images. Good images make it easier for customers to evaluate the product.

When using the [Image manager](/imaging/manage) to upload images to your
product detail page, additional pre-selected image variant types are
recommended for your product, based on the product category style guide. If
you want to include a variant that is not pre-selected, select the dropdown
arrow icon next to the variant name to replace it with another variant
identifier code.

Descriptions of the different variants and their four-character code are shown
in the following table.
