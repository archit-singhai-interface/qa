The A-to-z Guarantee applies to all customers for orders directly fulfilled by
our sellers. To prevent A-to-z Guarantee claims, we suggest that you follow
these best practices:  

  1. **Shipping**
     * **Include valid tracking for all deliveries** : Tracked shipments allow customers to see the status of their delivery without needing to contact you. Amazon will grant a delivery-related claim in the customer’s favor if you have not provided tracking details. For more information, go to [Valid tracking rate](/gp/help/G201817070) and [Order defect rate](/gp/help/200285170). To edit order tracking information:
       * Go to **Orders** , and then **Manage orders**.
       * Enter the order ID into the Advanced search.
       * Once you find the correct order, click **Edit shipment** and provide the revised tracking number.
     * **Use supported couriers** : Amazon offers [Buy Shipping services](/gp/help/G200202220) that enables sellers in certain stores to buy pre-paid, tracked shipping labels from Amazon and have packages collected directly from their premises.
       * When you ship on time using Amazon's Buy Shipping, there is no impact to your account health or [Order defect rate](/gp/help/200285170) for granted delivery related claims (as long as you respond to customer inquiries within 48 hours), although you may still be responsible for reimbursing the customer.
     * **Request additional proof of delivery** : When you buy additional Proof of Delivery (POD), which may include signature confirmation, this provides Amazon with delivery signals that show the package was delivered to the exact customer address and helps us determine if a customer has received their item. We always suggest you use carriers that can provide POD upon request. When you promptly respond in Buyer-Seller Messages to a customer with a missing order inquiry and attach a copy of a signed POD (or other documents such as photo delivery or a customer request for contactless delivery), a claim is less likely to be granted in a customer’s favor, which is why signature delivery is helpful. If it's unclear whether an item has been received by the customer (for example, if there is no signature confirmation or where the customer informs Amazon that the item has not been received), a customer’s claim is more likely to be granted to maintain a great customer experience.
     * **Confirm shipments before expected ship date** : Ensure that the courier picking up deliveries first scans the customer’s package on or before the ‘ship by’ date. It's important to confirm that you have sent the order on or before the expected ship date so that customers can see the status of their order and understand when to expect delivery without the need to contact you. Failure to ship on time negatively impacts your [Late shipment rate](/gp/help/G200285190) and if you do not promptly resolve the issue with the customer, it is likely to result in a claim being granted in the customer’s favor. 
     * **Ensure delivery is completed before the estimated delivery date** : Notify the customer if a delivery is delayed. If the delivery is late and you do not resolve the issue with the customer, it is likely to result in a granted claim.
  2. **Products**
     * **Describe products accurately and provide clear images** : This helps to ensure that customers have clear expectations about your products. Your products must match the correct ASIN and must be classified in accordance with our [condition guidelines](/gp/help/200339950). Never use condition notes as a method to describe omissions or differences from the product listed on the detail page (such as "Like new but missing lens cap"). All listings must match the product detail page exactly.
     * **Promptly cancel any out-of-stock orders** : Email customers to let them know why their order was canceled so they are not waiting for their items to arrive.
  3. **Customer service**
     * **Respond to customers within 48 hours** : If customers reach out to you, respond within 48 hours to ensure a good customer experience. If a customer requests a return, it is best practice to respond within 24 hours by directing the customer to submit a return request on the customer’s Orders page. Failure to respond to a customer inquiry or return request within 48 hours is also likely to result in a granted claim and an immediate debit to your account.
     * **Delay due to vacation, illness, or disruption** : If you are unable to fulfill orders due to vacation, illness, or disruption (such as employee illness, government lockdowns, carrier strikes, customs enforcement, weather related, or any other reason), you must suspend selling on Amazon and update your account settings to receive return request emails with links to authorize, close, or reply.

You can also have Amazon automatically authorize return requests. You are
responsible for responding to messages from customers within 48 hours, so it
is important that you update your account settings accordingly. In addition,
if you ship items late for any reason and you have not updated your listing
status, it is likely to result in a granted claim and an immediate debit to
your account. For more information, go to [How do I set my return
preferences?](/gp/help/201817390), [Communicate with buyers using the Buyer-
Seller Messaging Service](/gp/help/G200389080), and [Listing status for
vacations, holidays, and other absences](/gp/help/200135620).

     * **Refund customers proactively** : If a customer contacts you for a refund, consider promptly providing the refund so that they do not need to file a claim.
  4. **Returns**
     * Authorize and respond to all return requests.
       * You must authorize, respond, or both to all return requests. It is best practice to respond to all return requests within 24 hours. Failure to respond to a return request within 48 hours will result in a granted claim and an immediate debit to your account.
       * You must authorize all eligible returns regardless of the category. A return is eligible when it is requested within Amazon’s standard 30-day return window or extended return window.
       * If you close a return request, always clarify the reason why the customer was not eligible for a return.
       * You can deny out of policy requests, but you must do so within 48 hours. If a request is out of policy, clarify the reason why the customer was not eligible for a return.
       * For more information, go to [Manage seller-fulfilled returns](/gp/help/G200708210).
     * **Communicate clear instructions to the customer on return process.**
       * If you authorize a return request and you want the item to be returned, provide either a local return address or a prepaid return label and guidelines on how to return the product. Failure to do so within 5 days from receiving a return request may result in a granted claim and an immediate debit to your account.
       * If you authorize a return request and you do not want the item to be returned, proactively refund the customer in full and clarify that they need not return the item.
     * **Refund the customer within 2 business days of receiving the return.**
       * If you choose to have the customer return the item before you process the refund, you must process the refund within 2 business days of receiving the return. Failure to do so may result in a granted claim and an immediate debit to your account.

For more information, go to [Returns, refunds, cancellations, and
