This policy page covers the general quality requirements for a product to be
eligible for sale in the Amazon Renewed store. The outlined requirements are
intended to serve as a minimum required quality bar across all Renewed product
categories. Requirements in Appendix A will supersede the general product
quality requirements. Requirements in Appendix B will supersede both Appendix
A and general product quality requirements. Requirements in Appendix C will
supersede Appendix B, A, and general quality requirements.

A. Sellers warrant that all Renewed products meet the following requirements:

Permitted products

  * All Renewed products must be capable of being repaired, refurbished or remanufactured and tested to look and work in accordance with our quality policy. Repair, refurbish or remanufactured capability means that products must have electrical or mechanical components that can be replaced or upgraded to new or like-new condition.
  * For a list of permitted products and more details on our listing restrictions, go to [Amazon Renewed program policies](/gp/help/GZZVY5QX4DZHWHSW).

  

  1. Product inspection and testing
     * Each product must be inspected, repaired (if applicable), cleaned, and tested to meet cosmetic and functional standards.
     * Any potential refurbishing operation will use only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts. Such parts can be new or refurbished to a like-new condition. 
     * No signs of cosmetic damage, such as scratches or dents, should be noticeable when the product is held 12 inches or 30 centimeters away unless stated otherwise in Appendix A or B.

**Note:** Grade 2 (Good condition) and Grade 3 (Acceptable condition) offers
should only be created under Wireless and Personal Computers product
categories. Amazon Renewed will remove any Grade 2 and Grade 3 offers that are
created under product categories different from Wireless and Personal
Computers. Lack of compliance can result in the removal of Amazon Renewed
selling privileges.

     * No dead or stuck pixels should be present on products that contain displays. Displays should illuminate like the new equivalents, with no signs of dimming.
     * When present, camera lenses must have no cosmetic imperfections.

     * Where applicable, products must be restored to their original factory settings and must be fully unlocked for use.

     * Accessories cannot be sold as standalone ASINs.
     * Only OEM accessories will be used. The accessories can be new or refurbished to a like-new condition, under the same requirements laid out in Paragraph A.1 of this document. Consumable accessories (for example, air and water filters, brushes, and strings) must be in new condition.  

       1. For Apple products, see Appendix B.1 at the bottom of this document. 
     * Where applicable, wall plugs must be compatible to the region where the product is sold.

     * Cables and cords should not have exposed wires or cracked wire insulation.
  3. Instruction manuals
     * Either instruction manuals or a link to the manufacturer’s instruction manual should be included in the shipment, to provide a better buyer experience.

  4. End-user data
     * The seller must perform a complete forensic destruction of all personally identifiable information (PII) and all other data that originated with or related to an end user contained on or in any hardware, software, or media component of each product before sale. Examples of such end-user data include but are not limited to name, date of birth, fingerprints or other biometric data, Social Security number, street address, email address, cloud storage account, and credit card information.
     * Any end-user data must be removed in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard on Media Sanitization or other applicable local regulations and standards. Refer to NIST-SP.800-88.rev.1 for additional information.
  5. Packaging
     * Products must be packaged either in their original packaging or in a new cardboard box. No mailing and padded envelopes will be used. 
     * Packaging must be clean and free of any damage, markings, and non-product- related labels and stickers.
     * If original packaging is used, the serial numbers on the box and the product must match. In addition, labeling must be applied on at least two sides of the package, explicitly identifying the product as "Renewed", "Refurbished", "Remanufactured," or another applicable derivative.
     * Products and accessories must be compartmentalized and must not be in direct contact with each other. They will be secured and not able to move inside the box during handling and shipping. All OEM accessories must be sealed in a bag.
     * Product packaging must successfully pass drop tests based on widely adopted standards like those of the American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM) or the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA).
     * All shipment of products containing lithium batteries (both lithium ion and lithium metal) are classified as Class 9 - Miscellaneous Dangerous Goods. Refer to [IATA](https://www.iata.org/Pages/default.aspx) and [ICAO](https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx) requirements as the product might require proper identification, classification, packaging, marking, and labeling.

**B. Guarantee and warranty.** When available in the store, Renewed products
will be covered by the Renewed Guarantee and you will be responsible for any
claims under the guarantee. See Appendix C for specific store requirements
pertaining to required coverage.

**C. Quality controls and enforcement**

     * Failure to comply with the quality requirements might lead to the removal of Renewed selling privileges, and might require the submission of a plan of action to remediate and regain these privileges.
