## Prepare your order cancellation file

Use the Order Cancellation template to create an order cancellation file. This
template includes validation macros that will help you successfully complete
the template. You can choose whether to turn these macros on or off. We
suggest that you keep them on until you learn how to use the template.

To prepare your order cancellation file:  

  1. Download and save a copy of the **Order Cancellation** template.
  2. Open the file and review the **Data Definitions** tab.
  3. On the the **OrderCancellation** tab, enter the information about your cancellation, referring to the Data Definitions tab when necessary.
  4. When you are finished, select the **OrderCancellation** tab, and then click the File menu and select **Save As.**
  5. Give your file a name, and in the "Save as Type" field, select **Text (Tab-delimited) (*.txt)**.

**Note:** When saving your file, you might receive the following warnings.
Select **Yes** for both.

  * "The selected file format (the tab-delimited text file) does not support workbooks containing multiple worksheets."
  * "Your file contains features incompatible with the selected Text (Tab delimited) file format."

## Upload your order cancellation file

Once you have finished adding information about your cancellation, upload your
file on the Upload Order Related Files page.

To upload your Order Cancellation file:  

  1. On the **Orders** link, select **Upload Order Related Files**. 
  2. Select **Order Cancellation** at the top of the page.
  3. Under **Upload Your Cancellation File** , click **Browse** to locate your tab-delimited text file.
  4. Select the file and click **Upload Now**.

## Review your uploaded file

You can review the status of your upload on the [Upload Order Related
Files](/gp/transactions/uploadOrderCancellation.html) page, under "Review File
Status History" in the Status/Results column. If you need to access your
report at a later date, the most recent 10 uploads are available here.

After your file is processed, the Status/Results column displays the number of
records processed, activated, and uploaded with errors (not activated).

**Data errors**

If any items are not activated because of errors, there will be a non-zero
number next to "Number of records with errors."

To correct these errors:  

  1. Click View Processing Report in the Actions column.
  2. Identify and correct any data errors. Save your file as described above.
  3. Return to [Upload Order Related Files](/gp/transactions/uploadOrderCancellation.html) and upload your file.

Report](/gp/help/201576740).
