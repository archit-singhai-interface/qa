Properly preparing products that are or contain liquids, pastes, gels, and
creams can help ensure they are protected from breaking or leaking throughout
the fulfillment process.

Liquids can cause damage during shipping and when stored. Securely pack
liquids — including viscous products such as pastes, gels, and creams —to
protect buyers, Amazon associates, and other products.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blockage of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charges for
unplanned services.

Before reading further, determine the following details about the liquid,
paste, gel, or cream product you want to sell:

  * Is your product classified as a dangerous good? See the [Dangerous goods identification guide](/gp/help/201003400). 
  * Is the container fragile (glass) or non-fragile? 
  * If the container is glass, does it hold 4.2 oz or more, or less than 4.2 oz?
  * Is your product sold as a set or individually?
  * Is your product expiration-dated? See [Expiration-dated FBA inventory](/gp/help/201003420) for more information.

## Basic drop test requirements

All liquid, paste, gel, and cream products must be able to withstand a 3-foot
drop test without the contents of the container leaking or spilling. A drop
test consists of five 3-foot drops onto a hard surface:

  * Flat on base
  * Flat on top
  * Flat on longest side
  * Flat on shortest side
  * On a corner

## Products regulated as dangerous goods

Dangerous goods (also known as hazardous materials or hazmat) are substances
or materials that may pose a risk to health, safety, property, or the
environment during storage, handling, or transportation because they contain
flammable, pressurized, corrosive, or otherwise harmful substances. To find
out if your product is a dangerous good, see the [Dangerous goods
identification guide](/gp/help/201003400) and watch the [Dangerous Goods
Awareness](/learn/courses?ref_=su_courses_c109_m402&courseId=109&moduleId=402&modLanguage=English&videoPlayer=airy)
video in Seller University.

If your product is a liquid, paste, gel, or cream and is regulated as
dangerous good — such as perfume, certain bathroom cleaners, polish removers,
and permanent ink — the following prep is required. For more information,
visit [Packaging and prep requirements](/gp/help/200141500).

Container type | Container size | Prep requirements  
---|---|---  
Non-fragile | Any | Poly-bag  
Fragile | 4.2 oz or more | Poly-bag, bubble wrap, and box  
Fragile | Less than 4.2 oz | Poly-bag or bubble wrap  
  
**Note:** All liquid products regulated as dangerous goods must be poly-bagged
to prevent a leak or spill during transportation, regardless of the product
seal.

## Products not regulated as dangerous goods

For liquid, paste, gel, and cream products that are not regulated as dangerous
goods, the following prep is required. For more information, visit [Packaging
and prep requirements](/gp/help/200141500).

Container type | Container size | Prep requirements | Exceptions  
---|---|---|---  
Non-fragile | Any | Poly-bag | If the liquid is double sealed and passes a drop test, no bagging is required. (See the table below for examples of double seals.)   
Fragile | 4.2 oz or more  | Bubble wrap |   
Fragile | Less than 4.2 oz | No prep required |   
  
## Additional prep requirements

If your product is bundled to be sold as a set or is expiration-dated, be sure
follow the prep requirements listed below **_in addition_** to the ones
outlined above.

  * **Sold as a set:** Regardless of container type, products sold as a set must be packed together to prevent separation. Additionally, if you are selling a bundled set (for example, a pack of three bottles of the same shampoo), you must provide a unique ASIN for the set that is different from the ASIN for individual bottles. For bundled sets, the barcodes on the individual items must not face outward, to help make sure the Amazon warehouse associate scans the barcode for the pack, not the barcode for the individual items inside. Multi-unit bundled products must meet the following criteria:
    * Packaging should not give way when pressure is applied to any of the sides.
    * Products are securely held in place inside the packaging.
    * Packaging is sealed with tape, glue, or staples.
To learn more, see the “Sold as set” section of the [Packaging and prep
requirements](/gp/help/200141500) help page.

  * **Expiration-dated:** Expiration-dated products must have labels with the expiration date in 36-point font or larger applied to the outside of the packaging.

**Important:** Failure to include the expiration date on the outside of the
prepped item may result in the item being relabeled at additional cost to you.

To learn more, see [Expiration-dated FBA inventory](/gp/help/201003420).

## Definition of a double seal

A double seal is defined as **a tightened lid that cannot be easily opened**
and **one** of the following:

Other types of double seal | Example
