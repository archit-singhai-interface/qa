Every time you upload a text file, Amazon creates and posts a processing
report. This processing report identifies whether your feed was successful and
if any specific errors encountered during processing.

##

When you upload your file, a status box confirms that we have received your
file.

The **File Upload Status** section on this page displays the date, time, batch
ID, status, and results of your most recent upload. There is also a column
that provides links you can use for taking action based on the results. If
your feed has not completed processing, the **Status/Results** column shows
the following information:

Status: In Progress  
Number of records processed from this upload: 0  
Number of records that were activated: 0  
Number of records with errors: 0

You can use the **Refresh** to see the latest results.

After your file is processed, the **Status/Results** column shows updated
information, along with the **Actions** available.

If any items are not activated due to errors, click the **View Processing
Report** link to download the associated processing report. Use this report to
diagnose and correct errors in the file you uploaded. When you are ready to
upload the edited file, click the **Return to Upload page** link, and re-
upload your file. For more information, go to [Review a Processing
Report](/gp/help/200194300).

**Note:** To check your inventory file for common errors and warnings before
you upload it, go to [Use the Check My File feature](/gp/help/581).

##  Access your upload results

From the **Upload Products & Inventory** page, you can access the upload
status report for your file in the **Review File Status and History** section.
