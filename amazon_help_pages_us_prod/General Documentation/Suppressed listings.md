Our research shows an improved shopping experience when listings have complete
product information, with images, category (item-type), titles (parent
titles), and price per unit (PPU) along with less than 80 characters for
apparel, shoes, and luggage categories and 130 characters for all other
categories. This makes it easier for customers to find, evaluate, and purchase
products. As a result, we will hide (or suppress) from search and browse non-
media listings that do not meet certain standards. This means that a customer
will not be able to find a listing in search if that listing is suppressed.

## Suppressed child listings

We will also suppress the following incomplete listings, including:

  * Child listings in Shoes without: 
    * A **Department** value
    * A **Size** value
    * A **Color** value
  * Child listings in Jewelry with: 
    * A missing or invalid **Department** value, except for Jewelry Accessories
    * Incomplete or invalid **Material type** , **Metal type** , **Gem type** , and **Pearl type** specifications, except for Jewelry Accessories (as of August 1, 2017)
    * A UPC (if the brand is on the [Major jewelry brands](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/Jewelry_Major_Brands._CB296684570_.pdf) list)
  * Child listings in Watches and Luggage without: 
    * A **Department** value
  * Child listings in Consumables (Grocery, Beauty, Pets, and Health & Personal Care) without:
    * A unit count and value

**Note:** Image is required for all categories except for Digital, Alexa, and
Services.

## Suppressed images

These requirements also apply to listings with variations. For example, if a
listing has different sizes, its parent SKU and child SKUs for each size must
meet the requirements above.
