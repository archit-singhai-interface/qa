As an Amazon seller, you can charge a restocking fee in specific situations
when a buyer returns an item.

## When can you charge a restocking fee?

You can charge a restocking fee in the following scenarios:

  * An item is returned outside of [Amazon's return policy](/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=15015721&language=en_US&ref=ag_home_cont_G200708210). You can charge a restocking fee of up to 20% on items that are returned outside of the return window. However, you're not required to accept returns beyond the return window.
  * An item is returned in used, damaged, or materially different condition.

You may not charge a restocking fee for items that are returned in original
condition and within the return policy.

**Important:** A restocking fee is a percentage of the item's price. The item
price does not include shipping costs and is based on the item’s condition
upon return. Restocking fees apply only to returned items.

## How to charge a restocking fee

To charge a restocking fee, follow these steps:

  1. From the drop-down menu in Seller Central, select **Orders** and then select **Manage returns**.

  2. Enter the order ID in the search field to find the specific order.

  3. Click **Issue refund** to access the guided refund workflow.

## Restocking fee guidelines

Restocking fees should be charged fairly and in accordance with Amazon's
policies. Always provide clear documentation when applying these fees to
ensure transparency for both Amazon and buyers.

Amazon provides guidelines for restocking fee percentages based on the type of
item and its condition upon return. The refund workflow in Seller Central will
help you calculate the appropriate fee according to these guidelines:

Return request | Restocking fee  
---|---  
The buyer changes their mind* about a purchase and returns an item in the original condition** within the return window. | No restocking fee  
The buyer changes their mind* about a purchase and returns an item in the original condition** outside of the return window. | Yes, up to 20% of the item's price  
The buyer refuses delivery due to visible damage incurred during shipping or caused by the carrier. | No restocking fee. You pay for return shipping, but you can file a claim with the carrier or your insurance company, if you bought insurance.  
The buyer receives a used or damaged item. | No restocking fee. You can file a claim with the carrier or your insurance company, if you bought insurance.  
The buyer returns a used item with minor damage. | Yes, up to 25% of the item's price.  
The buyer returns a used item with severe damage. | Yes, up to 50% of the item's price.  
The buyer returns a book, within the return window, with obvious signs of use that was not caused by Amazon or you. | Yes, up to 50% of the item's price  
The buyer returns a CD, DVD, VHS tape, cassette tape, or vinyl record, within the return window, that has been opened (taken out of the plastic wrap). | Yes, up to 50% of the item's price  
The buyer changes their mind* about a purchase and returns a non-media item within the return window. But the item that you receive is damaged, missing parts, not in original condition, or has obvious signs of use for reasons not due to Amazon or seller error. | Yes, up to 50% of the item's price  
The buyer changes their mind* and returns open software or video games. | Yes, up to 100% of the item's price  
**The buyer returns a materially different item than what was delivered. | Yes, up to 100% of the item’s price   
The buyer returns an empty box or package. | Yes, up to 100% of the item’s price  
The buyer returns an item they received that is materially different from what they ordered. | No restocking fee  
Any other reason not listed here. | Go to [Refunds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=901926&language=en_US&ref=au_home_cont_G201725780).  
  
**Note:** * The buyer changes their mind and returns the item for one of the
following reasons, which are not due to Amazon or seller error:

  * Accidental order
  * Better price available
  * No longer needed or wanted

For new desktops, laptops, tablets, and other electronics (excluding
televisions, Amazon Renewed products, and Apple brand products): The product
is returned in original condition when the box is unopened (seal intact).

**Note:** ** If a buyer returns a materially different item, follow these
steps before charging a restocking fee:  

  1. Contact the buyer.
  2. Tell the buyer that they accidentally returned the wrong item. 
  3. Ask if the buyer wants the incorrect item returned to them.
  4. Offer the buyer the option to return the correct item for a refund. 

If no resolution is reached after following these steps, only then may you
charge a restocking fee of up to 100%.
