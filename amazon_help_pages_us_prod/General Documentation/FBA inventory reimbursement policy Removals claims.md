This page applies to eligible items lost or damaged by Amazon or a carrier
used by Amazon while removing your inventory from a fulfillment center to your
returns shipping address. The item must not have been returned to you because
you violated a program policy or other terms and conditions that apply to your
use of any Amazon selling service. The damage or loss must have occurred after
the item left an Amazon facility.

The process to a file a claim varies by where in the fulfillment process your
item is lost or damaged:
