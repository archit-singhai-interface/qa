Step 2 of the Send to Amazon process, [Confirm
Shipping](/gp/help/GWC4BVUFCZ2FKHQW), lets you choose to merge your shipment’s
workflow with other eligible workflows.

Shipments eligible for merger with other workflows may have printed labels and
have boxes labeled. Merging shipments allows you to add new boxes and keep
previously labeled boxes without reprinting and relabeling.

## Create a shipment that is eligible to be merged

  1. Create a new shipment by following the steps of the Send to Amazon workflow.

  2. Don’t proceed beyond step 4, [Confirm carrier and pallet information](/gp/help/GBJBZ65P2LHZM2DG), of the Send to Amazon workflow as it cannot be returned to previous step and you won’t be able to merge the shipment with another workflow.

**Note:** If your shipment is part of the Amazon Partnered Carrier program,
don’t confirm the carrier’s charges on step 4. Once you confirm these changes,
you won’t be able to merge the shipment with another workflow.

This shipment is eligible to be merged with future shipments if all of the
following conditions apply:

  * One or more shipments have the same origin / destination pair
  * Ship mode in workflows are all Less-Than-Truckload (LTL)
  * Placements splits are confirmed within one or more workflows
  * Combined boxes don’t exceed the Send to Amazon box limit
  * Pallet estimates don’t exceed 26 pallet floor spaces
  * Shipment is not Box-Level Placement
  * Items in both workflows are compatible
  * Does not include cross-border transportation programs (that is Amazon Global Logistics)
  * Shipment is created after the Carton Level Information submission in Step 1 or 1b

## Merge two or more shipments

To merge one eligible shipment with another eligible shipment, follow these
steps:

  1. Create a new shipment by following the steps of the Send to Amazon workflow.

  2. Proceed to step 2, [Confirm shipping](/gp/help/GWC4BVUFCZ2FKHQW)

  3. Check that you have two or more workflows that meet the eligibility requirements listed above.

  4. Select **I want to merge this workflow** after confirming the shipping mode.

  5. Select the workflow that you want to merge with the current workflow in the drop-down menu.

  6. Review the assigned shipments and any applicable estimated charges for shipping, prep, and labeling. If everything looks correct, select **Accept Merge and Confirm Destinations**.

  7. Continue to step 3, [Print box labels](/gp/help/GCUH6KKZA6PRA4E7), where you’ll print your box labels and any applicable Amazon Partnered Carrier program labels for your shipments.
