The Referral Fee Preview Report shows the estimated referral fee amount for
each of your current listings on Amazon. The referral fee shown in the report
is based on your current listed item price and does not account for shipping
or gift wrap charges applied at the time of purchase. Additional selling fees,
including variable closing fees, may apply when your item is sold.

The information contained in this report may be up to 72 hours old. The report
can only be requested once per 24 hours.

To download the report, go to the Reports link and select [Inventory
Reports](/gp/item-manager/ezdpc/openPickup.html), then use the report type
drop-down to select **Referral Fee Preview Report**.
