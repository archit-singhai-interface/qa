On the **Contact Buyer** page, certain contact reasons are available for you
to select based on the order status and specific product categories.

Amazon does not block messages if they are necessary for completing an order.
If your message was blocked, it is due to the buyer opting out of non-critical
messages from sellers, or Amazon treats the selected contact reason as one
that is not critical for completing the order.

To send a message related to a specific order, follow these steps in Seller
Central:

  1. Go to the **Orders** menu and select **Manage Orders**.

  2. Locate the order that you want to contact the buyer about.

  3. In the **Order Details** column, click the name of the buyer to open the **Contact Buyer** page.

  4. On the next page, select a contact reason, complete the message, and click **Send**.

**Important:** You will not be able to edit the subject line of the emails
sent from Seller Central. Amazon will deliver the messages related to
completing an order.

To send a message related to a specific order, follow these steps using your
email client:  

    1. Include the word **[Important]** , with brackets as shown, anywhere in the subject line. The email will not be blocked and you won't receive a bounce back message.
    2. All proactive Permitted Messages must include the 17-digit order ID and be in the buyerâ€™s language of preference.

**Note:** You can use capital or lowercase letters, but the word important
must be surrounded by brackets to be effective. For example, the subject line
"Need additional information" should instead be "[Important] Need additional
information" or "Need additional information [Important]."

**Important:****Use of [Important] for non-critical messages may result in the
suspension of your selling privileges.** If you use other subjects, the
message will bounce back if the buyer has opted out. Buyers can also flag
messages as inappropriate. Therefore, the content of your messages should be
limited to requesting only the information you absolutely need to complete an
order.
