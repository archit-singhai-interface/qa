The following terms supplement your seller agreement and apply to your
participation in the Get Paid Faster Service, which provides an option to
accelerate the application of Sales Proceeds from invoiced orders to your
available balance:

  * **Election** : Sales Proceeds from invoiced orders are normally credited to your available balance on or before the seventh day following the applicable invoice due date. You may elect, in the manner we designate, to accelerate the application of certain Sales Proceeds for invoiced orders (net of applicable fees) to your available balance by activating the Get Paid Faster Service. Once activated, your election to use the Get Paid Faster Service will apply to all future invoiced orders until you deactivate it.
  * **Fees** : In exchange for the accelerated application of Sales Proceeds to your available balance, a processing fee of 1.5% will be applied to all related Sales Proceeds. This processing fee will be in addition to any other fees payable to Amazon or its Affiliates under your seller agreement, and will be paid to Amazon Services LLC.
  * **Remittance schedule** : We will remit your available balance to you, including any Sales Proceeds applied on an accelerated basis, in accordance with the remittance schedule defined in your seller agreement.
