**Individual sellers:** This feature is available to [Amazon Business
sellers](/hz/b2bregistration) and sellers with [Professional selling
plans](/gp/help/64491).

An [order report](/order-reports-and-feeds/reports/ref=xx_orderrpt_dnav_xx) is
a tab-delimited text file that lists all products sold during a set time
period. It includes the buyer information needed to fulfill orders. It does
not include the buyer's confidential information, like billing address or
credit card information.

An order report only displays information for seller-fulfilled orders you have
received during the number of days you select, including those you have
canceled or confirmed as shipped. For Amazon-fulfilled orders (through FBA),
go to [All Orders Report](/gp/help/G200547170).

You can manually generate an order report in Seller Central at any time for
the past 1, 2, 7, 15 or 30 days. Seller Central doesnâ€™t support generating
order reports beyond 30 days. We recommend that you archive your daily order
reports to preserve historical data. To investigate specific orders that are
older than 30 days, use the [Search orders](/gp/help/G28151) feature on
**Manage Orders** page.

You can also schedule recurring order reports as needed. For details on
scheduling recurring order reports, go to [Schedule Order
Reports](/gp/help/G201648760).
