FBA Prep Service helps you to properly package and prepare your shipments for
Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Correct [packaging and prep](/gp/help/200141500)
helps to reduce receiving delays and protect your products from damage.

If you use FBA Prep Service, we’ll prepare your products for a per-unit fee,
including labeling, bubble-wrap, stickering and bagging. After the service is
enabled, you can choose to prepare your own products or have Amazon prepare
them for you.

When you plan your shipment in the Send to Amazon workflow, we’ll provide an
estimated FBA Prep Service fee depending on the services required for each
product.

**Important:** If you choose to prepare your own FBA products and don’t comply
with packaging and prep requirements, receipt of your shipment may be delayed.

## Eligible products

The following products qualify for FBA Prep Service:

  * **Condition:** Any (new, used, collectible, and refurbished)
  * **Product type:** Any (media and non-media)
  * **Barcode:** Each unit must have a scannable barcode (for example, ISBN, UPC, EAN, or JAN). The unit's barcode must not be punched out, marked over, covered, or obstructed.

## Enable FBA Prep Service

**Products with packaging and preparation requirements**

To enable FBA Prep Service for products with packaging and preparation
requirements set by Amazon, select one of the following in the **Who preps?**
field:

  * **By Amazon** if you want Amazon to prep the product.
  * **By seller** if you want to prepare the product yourself.

**Note:** If your products are classified as fragile, glass, or sharp, even if
you choose prep **By Amazon** , you must package them in advance. This is to
ensure they can withstand transit to our fulfillment centers and be safely
handled by our FBA Prep Service associates.

**Products without packaging and preparation requirements**

If your products don’t have packaging and preparation requirements set by
Amazon, you can choose how to prepare your products based on the category:  

  1. Click **Choose prep category** from the **Prep guidance** tab.
  2. In the pop-up window, select the category that best fits your product from the **Prep category** drop-down list. You can select **No prep** if you believe that no prep is required.
  3. Select **Amazon** in the **Who preps?** column.

If you don’t follow these steps, or if you select **By seller** in the **Who
preps?** column, you’ll be responsible to prepare your own products.

For more information, download our guide [How to Prep
Products](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-
help/QRG/FBA_Prep_Products_en-US.pdf) or go to [Product packaging
requirements](/gp/help/G200141500).

**Choose who labels the products**

After determining who will prep your products, go to the **Label product** tab
to choose whether you or Amazon will apply labels to each unit.

If Amazon prepares your products, the [FBA Label
Service](/gp/help/external/G200483750) will be automatically set to **By
Amazon** for products that require bubble wrap, opaque bagging, or that are
sold as a set.

You can choose a default in your FBA settings, and changing the default won’t
affect previously created shipments or label preferences already defined for
specific items.

**Note:** The FBA Label Service is optional. All products must have a
scannable label that is visible after preparation is complete. Amazon may
verify the weight and dimensions of a product by using representative samples.
Our information about a product’s weight and dimensions will be used to
calculate fees if this information differs from your information, and may be
changed to reflect updated measurements.
