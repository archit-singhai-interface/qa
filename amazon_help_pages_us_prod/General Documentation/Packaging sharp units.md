On this page, you will learn how to properly prep products that have exposed
sharp edges so that they are protected throughout the fulfillment process.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

Sharp units have a sharp or pointed edge that, when exposed, is a safety
hazard for Amazon associates and customers who receive the units. Sharp units
must be packaged or overboxed so that the sharp or pointed edge will not
become exposed during receipt, stocking, shipment preparation, or delivery to
the customer. For information on overboxing, scroll down to **Prep required**
on [Prepare your products for FBA shipping](/gp/help/G201021850).

##  Packaging guidelines

Do... | Do Not...  
---|---  
  
  * Ensure that packaging completely covers the sharp object.
  * Use blister packs when possible. The blister pack must cover the sharp edge and be securely fastened to the Unit so that the Unit does not slide around within the blister pack.
  * Secure the sharp Unit to a footprint with a plastic fastener or similar restraint and wrap the Unit in plastic if possible.
  * Ensure that the Unit cannot cut through the packaging.

|

  * Pack sharp products in unsafe molded footprints with plastic covering.
  * Pack sharp products with cardboard or plastic sheaths alone unless the sheath is of a rigid, durable plastic and secured to the product.
