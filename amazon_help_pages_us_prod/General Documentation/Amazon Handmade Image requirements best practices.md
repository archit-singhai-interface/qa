High-quality product images display your work in the best manner possible and
drives discoverability of your listings on Amazon. Customers shop visually,
based on images that target their individual taste. Use the information below
on how to optimize your images, which is one of the most important factors
when shopping for handcrafted products. See this video to learn about [how to
optimize your Handmade product
images.](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/learn/courses?moduleId=3181cd9b-1483-4039-94e4-25436be0ef54&sid=SU-

## Product image requirements

  * Images must accurately represent the product and show only the product that is for sale.
  * The product and all its features must be clearly visible.
  * Images must not contain nudity or be sexually suggestive.
  * Main image requirements:
    * Main images must have a pure white background (pure white blends in with the Amazon search and product detail pages—RGB color values of 255, 255, 255).
    * Main images must be high quality photographs of the actual product (graphics, illustrations, mockups, or placeholders are not allowed). 
    * Main images must not show excluded accessories, props that might confuse the customer, text that is not part of the product, or logos, watermarks, or inset images.
  * Image sizing requirements:
    * Images should be 1,000 pixels or larger in either height or width. This minimum size requirement enables the zoom function on the website. Zoom has been proven to enhance sales. 
    * Images must not exceed 10,000 pixels and should not be less than 500 pixels on the longest side.
  * Amazon accepts JPEG (.jpg), TIFF (.tif) or GIF (.gif) file formats, but JPEG is preferred.
    * Our servers do not support animated .gifs.

## Product image best practices

  * We recommend each product to have more than four images – one main image on white background and three alternative images to show additional details or lifestyle views of the product.
  * Alternative images (images other than the main image) should be used to show environment, lifestyle, product detail, packaging, or scale of product. They should also be used to show available customization options.
  * If models are used, they must be standing. Models should not be displayed in sitting, kneeling, or lying down postures.
  * If a model is used for Children’s or Baby clothing, you should include flat images of the item.
  * Images of intimate clothing, lingerie, and swimwear products cannot be sexually explicit or obscene, as determined at the sole discretion of Amazon.
  * The product should typically fill at least 85% of the frame. If the product is shown in an environment, it should fill at least 50%.
  * The product should be thoughtfully laid out, well lit, and in focus.
  * The product should have sharp focus and ideally not a shallow depth of field.
  * Crop distracting shapes that appear in the background to retain highlight on the product.
