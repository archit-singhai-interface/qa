To upload product images, follow these instructions:  

  1. Find the product you want to upload an image for:  

    1. For new products: Under **Catalog** , click [Add Products](/productsearch/ref=xx_catadd_dnav_%5E). 
    2. For existing products: On the [Manage Inventory](/inventory/ref=xx_invmgr_dnav_xx) page, edit the product you want to add an image for on this page.
  2. Click the **Images** tab.
  3. Under **Main** , click **Choose Fle**. 

If you have secondary images, upload them using the boxes below the Main
Image.

##  Add an image

There are several ways to add a product image to Amazon:

  * Use the [Add a Product](/productsearch/ref=xx_addlisting_dnav_help) tool to add an image when you create a new listing.
  * Use the [Manage Inventory](/inventory/ref=xx_invmgr_dnav_xx) tool to add an image to an existing listing.
  * If you use inventory files, specify the product image URL in the inventory file.

Images may take up to 72 hours to appear on a product detail page.

Are you having problems uploading images? If you are seeing an "[Invalid URL
format](/gp/help/30601) error" or if you face any other URL issues, you can
search for "image error" in Help for common image-related errors and find more
information.

**Note:** Uploading an image does not guarantee that it will be displayed on
the product detail page or search pages. Amazon uses complex image ranking
technology to determine display images. Follow the guidelines provided in the
[Amazon product image requirements](/gp/help/G1881).
