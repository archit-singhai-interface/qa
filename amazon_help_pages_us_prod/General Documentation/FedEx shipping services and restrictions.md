**Use FedEx through Amazon Buy Shipping**

When you purchase FedEx shipping services through Buy Shipping, the carrier’s
fees for shipping and related services will be billed to your Seller Central
account. If you have a shipper account directly with FedEx, then you can also
link your FedEx account to your Seller Central account to access your
negotiated FedEx rates, in which case FedEx’s fees are paid directly by you to
FedEx.

If you experience any issues with purchasing FedEx shipping labels through Buy
Shipping, make sure that your ship-from address is properly formatted and
represents a valid street address. The address line must be less than 30
characters, must contain a two-character state code, and cannot be a PO box.

By purchasing labels through Buy Shipping, you agree to the [Amazon Buy
Shipping services - terms and conditions](/gp/help/G200672320).

**Access negotiated rates or connect your own FedEx rates**

[Buy Shipping](/gc/sell-online/amazon-buy-shipping) enables you to purchase
labels from trusted carriers through Amazon, while also getting account health
protection related to delivery issues. We frequently negotiate better rates
with carriers on your behalf. You can access Buy Shipping through [Seller
Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHN4V2K38ZA&t=226s), [Shipping API
V2](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-shipping/docs/shipping-
api-v2-reference), or select [Multi-channel
integrators](/gp/help/GZZPMC9QLNBX48RP). Additionally, if you want to use your
own rates, you can [connect your FedEx rates](/carrier-preferences/main)
directly on Seller Central and access on your preferred channel.

Whether you connect your own rates or use our negotiated rates, you’ll have
access to account health protection offered by Buy Shipping:  

  1. **Protection against delivery claims:** Ship your orders on time and get A-to-z claim protection* and SAFE-T claim refunds. 
  2. **On-time delivery rate:** Decrease the likelihood of late deliveries by 34% by accessing shipping methods that reliably deliver on time**.
  3. **Fulfill orders faster:** Get automatic shipping confirmation and valid tracking on all your orders.

_Notes:_

_*To be eligible for A-to-z claim protection you must: 1) purchase the
shipping label on Buy Shipping, 2) ship on time, which will be considered at
the moment of the carrier’s first scan, not when you confirm shipment), and 3)
respond to any customer inquiry in Buyer-Seller Messages within 48 hours._

_**As compared with Amazon sellers who purchase shipping labels outside Buy
Shipping._

**Shipping rates**

When you purchase delivery or related services from FedEx via your Seller
Central account, you agree to pay the fees associated with those services,
including the higher of weight-based rates vs. dimension-based rates and any
surcharges billed by the carrier in accordance with their policies. Rates are
subject to change at any time without notice. For more information, go to [Buy
Shipping services - terms and conditions](/gp/help/G200672320).

**FedEx size and weight restrictions**

FedEx reserves the right to adjust shipping charges when they weigh and
measure your shipment at their facility. To dispute shipping charges, contact
FedEx.

Shipments that require additional handling due to size and weight restrictions
may result in surcharges from FedEx. A complete list can be found by visiting
the FedEx official [website](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/rate-
changes/additional-shipping-fees.html). To reduce instances of adjusted
shipping charges, ensure you accurately report the weight and dimensions of
your shipment and review FedEx [dimensional weight
rules](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/small-business/peer-insights/packaging-
tips/what-is-dimensional-weight.html).

## No PO box deliveries

FedEx shipping options are not available for orders with a PO box delivery
address. FedEx ships to street addresses only.

## Print labels

FedEx labels purchased on Amazon are rendered in 4x6 PNG, 4x6 ZPL, and 8.5x11
PDF.

## Link your FedEx account

To link your FedEx account, go to [Manage your carrier
accounts](/gp/help/200785170).

## FedEx shipping methods restrictions

The following restrictions apply to FedEx Ground Economy:

  * Shipment of packages from 1-70 lb and up to 130 inches in length.
  * Bound printed matter (BPM) and media mail options are not available on Buy Shipping.
  * Currently only available with Amazon’s pre-negotiated rates.

**The following restrictions apply to FedEx One Rate:**

When choosing a FedEx One Rate shipping method, there are two ways to see a
FedEx One Rate quote and ship the item.

  

  1. You can use a FedEx flat-rate envelope, pack, box or tube. Refer to the [FedEx One Rate website](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/one-rate.html) to order these items. FedEx One Rate will show as an available service when the package dimensions input (Length–Width–Height) exactly match one of the FedEx One Rate standard sizes as outlined in the table below.
  2. You can use your own packaging, as long as the volume aligns with the corresponding small, medium, large, and extra-large box restrictions in the table below.

FedEx One Rate packages are available in the following sizes. If you are using
a FedEx flat-rate package, enter these dimensions exactly or save time and
pre-configure these package sizes:

**Subject to FedEx weight requirements, packages must be under 50 lb and
envelopes must be under 10 lb.

**Package name** | **Dimensions (L x W x H)** | **Weight Criteria**  
---|---|---  
Envelope 1 | 9.50 x 12.50 x 0.50 inches  | <=10 lb  
Envelope 2 | 9.50 x 15.50 x 0.50 inches  | <=10 lb  
Envelope 3 | 9.75 x 11.25 x 0.50 inches  | <=10 lb  
Pack 1 | 10.25 x 12.75 x 0.50 inches  | <=50 lb  
Pack 2 | 12.00 x 15.50 x 0.50 inches  | <=50 lb  
Pack 3 | 11.75 x 14.75 x 0.50 inches  | <=50 lb  
Pack 4 | 10.00 x 14.50 x 0.50 inches  | <=50 lb  
Small Box 1 | 10.88 x 1.50 x 12.38 inches  | <=50 lb  
Small Box 2 | 8.75 x 2.63 x 11.25 inches  | <=50 lb  
Medium Box 1 | 11.50 x 2.38 x 13.25 inches  | <=50 lb  
Medium Box 2 | 8.75 x 4.38 x 11.25 inches  | <=50 lb  
Large Box 1 | 12.38 x 3.00 x 17.50 inches  | <=50 lb  
Large Box 2 | 8.75 x 7.75 x 11.25 inches  | <=50 lb  
Extra Large Box 1 | 11.88 x 10.75 x 11.00 inches  | <=50 lb  
Extra Large Box 2 | 15.75 x 14.13 x 6.00 inches | <=50 lb  
Tube | 6.00 x 6.00 x 38.00 inches | <=50 lb  
  
If you are using your own box, ensure your package meets the following volume
and weight criteria.

**Package name** | **Volume (cubic inches)** | **Weight Criteria**  
---|---|---  
Small Box | Between 1 and 420 | 50 lb or less  
Medium Box | Between 421 and 650 | 50 lb or less  
Large Box | Between 651 and 1100 | 50 lb or less  
Extra Large Box | Between 1101 and 2200 | 50 lb or less  
  
To save time, create a preferred package size. We recommend pre-configuring
package sizes that match these specific dimensions so that on future orders
you can quickly use the package drop-down menu on Buy Shipping. To do this,
follow these steps:

  1. Go to [Buy Shipping preferences](/sbr/buyShippingPreferences) on Seller Central.

  2. Click **Edit** in the **References for all ship-from locations** section.

  3. Click **Add new package** and input the name (for example, FedEx One) and the dimensions (length, width, and height).

  4. Click **Save**.

The next time you use the Buy Shipping page, you’ll see your newly configured
package under the **Packaging** drop-down menu.
