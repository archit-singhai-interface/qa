## Our policy for paint removal products

**Products that you can’t sell under our policy**

Customers have to be confident that they’ll find a selection of safe,

If you believe that your product has been incorrectly classified as
prohibited, submit the following information to [highrisk-
chemicalsafety@amazon.com](mailto:highrisk-chemicalsafety@amazon.com):

  * A list of the ASINs that you believe have been misclassified
  * An explanation of why you believe that the ASINs have been misclassified
  * Evidence to demonstrate that the ASINs have been misclassified
