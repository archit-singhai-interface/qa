It is a normal part of selling on Amazon to see funds in the **Account level
reserve** section of the **Statement View** tab on your Payments report. It’s
the amount of money that is reserved to ensure that you have enough funds to
fulfill any financial obligations, such as refunds, claims, or chargebacks.

## Common reasons for an account level reserve

#### You have open A-to-z Guarantee claims

When an A-to-z Guarantee claim is filed, the claim amount will be reserved
until the claim is resolved. Some claims can take up to 14 days or longer to
resolve, but the reserve will be released after the claims are processed.

#### One or more of your orders has received a chargeback

Money might be reserved if your account has any chargebacks from transactions
in the last 90 days. The reserve will be released after the chargebacks are
processed.

#### Your seller performance has fallen below our benchmarks

Money might be reserved if performance metrics fall below our benchmarks.
Lower metrics frequently indicate a higher likelihood of claims, chargebacks,
and returns. Visit [Account Health](/performance/dashboard) dashboard
regularly to monitor your seller account’s adherence to the performance
targets and policies required to sell on Amazon.

#### Your account is under review

We might reserve funds if we notice an unexpected change in your sales or
account activity, or if you are a new seller with estimated delivery times
that are longer than your settlement period. Refer to [Account health
FAQ](/help/hub/reference/G200285250) to learn how to maintain great account
health.

#### Local regulations require us to withhold income tax from you (varies by
store)

Money might be reserved depending on your tax registration status and Amazon’s
responsibility to withhold and pay income tax based on your sales.

Multiple reasons for account level reserves can be applied at the same time.
For example, if an order for $40 has incurred a chargeback and an order for
$20 has an open A-to-z Guarantee claim, the total account level reserve from
those two orders would be $60.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How are account level reserves different from deferred transactions?

orders placed by Amazon Business customers are deferred while awaiting payment
by the buyer. For more information, go to [What is a deferred
