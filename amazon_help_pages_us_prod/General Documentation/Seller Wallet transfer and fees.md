## Transfer funds from my Seller Wallet account

Seller Wallet supports transfers to your bank accounts located in the
supported countries, regions, and currencies. For sellers who qualify, this
also includes transfers to USD-denominated bank accounts opened in Hong Kong.
For more information, go to [Seller Wallet supported countries and
currencies](/gp/help/GKD4GS8VTWVYCWRH).

For transfers to your USD-denominated bank account opened in Hong Kong, there
is a minimum transaction size of $2,500.

## Fees associated with Seller Wallet

It's free to create and maintain a Seller Wallet account. It's also free to
transfer money to domestic bank accounts. There is one fee for international
transactions, and it decreases as your business with Amazon grows. The
following table displays the fee details:

Cross-currency net proceeds (USD)1 | International transaction fee (transfers to USD bank accounts in Hong Kong) | International transaction fee (cross-currency transfers to CNY) | International transaction fee (cross-currency transfers excluding CNY)2  
---|---|---|---  
$10 million+ | 0.40% | 0.40% | 0.75%  
$1 million - $10 million | 0.50% | 0.50% | 1%  
$500,000 - $1 million | 0.60% | 0.60% | 1.25%  
$100,000 - $500,000 | 0.70% | 0.70% | 1.50%  
Less than $100,000 | N/A | 0.90% | 1.50%  
  
1International transaction fees are based on your total cross-currency net
proceeds during the trailing 12 months across all the Amazon stores. Cross-
currency proceeds are from an Amazon store that has different currency from
your home currency.

2Transfers to AED, CHF, MXN, and TWD have a flat fee of 1.5% instead.

## Exchange rates used for currency conversions out of Seller Wallet

Amazon works with our bank service providers to provide currency conversion
services from Seller Wallet using their market exchange rates. Amazon does not
add hidden fees or markups to the exchange rate from our bank service
provider. You are only charged the international transaction fee.

The currency conversion rate shown on Seller Wallet is an estimate sourced
from our rate providers. Seller Wallet’s bank service provider will use their
currency conversion rate at the time the transfer to your bank account is
processed. If your transfer fails, the funds will be returned to your Seller
Wallet account.

When you reinitiate a transfer, Seller Wallet’s bank service provider will use
the currency conversion rate at the time the transfer is reinitiated, which
may be different than the rate that was previously used. Amazon works to
ensure that you receive a competitive currency conversion rate. The currency
conversion rates that you see in newspapers or other print media are generally
wholesale or inter-bank rates.

## Determination of my tier for international transaction fees

Your net proceeds include your global selling accounts when your global
accounts are linked. On [Your global accounts](/account/management/ref), go to
the **Merge accounts** tab to connect all your regional accounts, and we will
apply the lowest rate available to your business.

Merging accounts does not allow you to settle funds from multiple Amazon
stores in your Seller Wallet account. Only your sales proceeds from Amazon.com
can be settled into your Seller Wallet account.

#### Example:

A Germany-based seller earned $500,000 on Amazon.com, $300,000 on
Amazon.co.uk, and $300,000 on Amazon.co.jp over the past 12 months. If the
seller does not merge accounts, we would offer the seller the following:

US: $500,000 → 1.5%

UK: $300,000 → 1.5%

Japan: $300,000 → 1.5%

If the seller merges accounts, we will lower the fee applied to both their
cross-border transfers from Seller Wallet and their disbursements using
[Amazon Currency Converter for Sellers](/gp/help/G200381250). This will save
the seller $5,500.

Total net proceeds (US + UK + Japan) = $1.1 million → 1.0%

## Disbursement cycle and Seller Wallet

Your disbursement cycle will remain the same. You will continue to receive
disbursements to your Seller Wallet account at the end your disbursement
cycle.

## Interest accrued on the amount in my Seller Wallet account

The funds in your Seller Wallet account will not accrue interest. Amazon is
not a bank and does not conduct banking activities.

## Length of time to keep funds in Seller Wallet

You can choose when and how much of your Seller Wallet funds to transfer. Go
to the [Seller Wallet Customer Agreement](/gp/help/G48JF654VVTLX9K7) for the
policies about dormant accounts.

## Physical bank accounts or payment service provider bank accounts

You can choose to use both physical bank accounts or payment service provider
bank accounts for transfers out of your Seller Wallet account. Go to [Add,
view, and update your bank account information](/gp/help/GWHNLFB8G85QAZ5W),
and follow the instructions to manage your bank accounts.

## Disbursement of proceeds from stores other than the US store

Only your proceeds from your sales in the US store can be settled into your
Seller Wallet account (in USD). For more information, go to [Add, view, and
update your bank account information](/gp/help/GWHNLFB8G85QAZ5W).

## Bank statement details on payments from Seller Wallet

Depending on your bank, the payment will have one of the following names:
Amazon, JP Morgan, Amazon and JP Morgan, or a correspondent bank. Contact your
bank if you need more information.

## View the transfers initiated from my Seller Wallet account
