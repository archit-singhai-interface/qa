Customers will first learn about your offers on a product detail page. The
following policies ensure that each product detail page covers a single unique
item. This helps give customers a clear and consistent buying experience. In
general, rules are as follows:

  * Comply with any relevant style guides and refrain from using HTML, JavaScript, or other code.
  * Exclude inappropriate content such as obscene or offensive materials, links or contact information, plot spoilers, reviews or requests for reviews, and advertising.
  * Accurately categorize and describe your products.
    * If listings are identified to be purposefully inaccurate, miscategorized, or deceptively described to circumvent any of Amazon’s [Category, product, and listing restrictions](/help/hub/reference/external/G200301050), customers’ accounts may be subjected to corrective actions, including but not limited to the immediate termination of selling privileges
  * Refrain from creating duplicate pages for a product that already has a detail page.
  * Create new detail pages for new products or versions.
  * Only create valid ''variations'' that relate to the primary product. For more details, go to [Variations Policy](/gp/help/201844590).

## Policies for writing listings

  * Comply with the relevant style guide for the product you're listing. You can find general rules that apply to all products in the [Amazon Services Quick Start Style Guide](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Lite_Inventory_Templates/Selling_on_Amazon_Quick_Start_Style_Guide.pdf). Some types of product have extra style guidelines. You can find the full set in the [Templates for Specific Categories](/gp/help/G1641).
  * Don’t use HTML, JavaScript, or other types of code in your product detail pages. As a special case, you can use line breaks </br> in the description.
  * None of the following are allowed in product detail page titles, descriptions, bullet points, or images:
    * Pornographic, obscene, or offensive content.
    * Phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, or website URLs.
    * Details of availability, price, or condition. 
    * Links to other websites for placing orders, or alternative shipping offers, such as free shipping.
    * Spoilers on Books, Music, and Video or DVD (BMVD) listings. This includes giving away plot details crucial to the suspense or surprise ending of a story.
    * Reviews, quotes, or testimonials.
    * Requests for positive customer reviews.
    * Adverts, promotional material, or watermarks on images, photos, or videos.
    * Time-sensitive information, such as dates of tours, seminars, or lectures.
  * Product titles must not have more than 200 characters, including spaces. This upper limit applies to all categories. Some categories might have a limit of even fewer characters. See the [Templates for Specific Categories for details](/gp/help/G1641).
  * Use capital letters only for the first letter of each word. Do not use all capital letters throughout the attribute. This applies to product titles, bullet points, and product descriptions. Use of Emojis, Emoticons, or symbols at the beginning of each word is prohibited.
  * Comply with Amazon listing standards for any product sold on Amazon. Failure to do so creates a negative customer experience and may result in your selling privileges being temporarily or permanently removed. This includes but is not limited to the following:
    * All products must be accurately categorized. To learn more about classifying your products correctly, see our help pages on [Product Classifier](/gp/help/200956770), [Browse Tree Guide](/gp/help/1661), and [ASIN Creation Policy](/gp/help/201844590).
    * Product titles, product descriptions, and bullet points must be clearly written and help customers understand the product.
    * Product information must be accurate and trustworthy, and not mislead customers about the products’ qualities or characteristics. To learn more about permissible claims, please review Amazon’s [Prohibited product claims](/help/hub/reference/external/G202024200) policy.
    * Product images must meet Amazon image standards, as well as any category-specific image guidelines. To learn more, see the [Product image requirements](/gp/help/G1881).
    * Ensure that the product detail page outlines any additional items that are essential to the function of the product.

## Policies for adding detail pages

  * You cannot add details which infringe upon the IP rights of other parties or individuals. For more details, check the [Intellectual Property Rights for sellers](/gp/help/G201361070) page.
  * You must not use false product identification information in product detail pages. This includes UPC codes and publication dates.
  * You must not create a product detail page for a product already in Amazon's catalog.
  * You must not use product detail pages to cross-merchandise or cross-promote a product.
  * For Books, Music, Videos, and DVDs (BMVD), you must not use a single product detail page to advertise more than one product. BMVD-only product bundles must be defined by the publisher or manufacturer and have a single ISBN, UPC, or EAN that is different from the product identifier of any single item in the bundle.

## Policies for editing detail pages

  * You may only update detail pages to better or more accurately describe the product as originally listed. For example, permissible updates include additional details, clarifications, grammatical fixes, or removal of content that violates Amazon policy.
  * You may not update detail pages to repeatedly add and remove prohibited claims as identified in Amazon’s [Prohibited product claims](/help/hub/reference/external/G202024200). Customers who are identified to repeatedly add and remove prohibited claims to circumvent this policy may be subjected to corrective actions, including but not limited to the immediate termination of selling privileges.
  * You may not repeatedly update your listing to add and remove prohibited images, disclaimers, or content to circumvent Amazon policy controls. Sellers must ensure their products are always accurately categorized, described, and in compliance with Amazon’s listing standards for any product sold on Amazon. Listing products on Amazon in a manner to avoid detection is considered evasive behavior. Evasive behavior does not have a path to reinstatement unless you provide valid proof of your adherence to all applicable laws and Amazon policies.
  * You must not use an existing listing for a new version of a product. This includes changes in color, size, material, features, and product name. Instead, create a new product detail page for each new version. For example, a manufacturer updates its streaming media player by adding a new remote control with four buttons instead of two. This product is materially different from the older version and it must be listed as a new ASIN.
  * If you choose to re-brand a product, refer to [Amazon Brand Name Policy](/gp/help/G2N3GKE5SGSHWYRZ) page for minor Brand name changes. Any major Brand Name change requests are considered re-branding and will not be supported. To protect Customer trust and ensure catalog quality, we ask that you create a new ASIN for the new product. 
  * You cannot edit, update, or add the product ID for a listing that has been created with GTIN exemption. Product ID is a non-editable value and cannot be modified once a listing is created. If you want to update the product ID for a listing that has been created with GTIN exemption, you must delete and create a new listing of the product with a GS1 approved product identifier.

## Guidance for editing detail pages associated with Brand Registry branded
ASINs

  * If several authorized users of a brand have the same selling role and contribute to the same ASIN, those contributions will be weighted equally for display on the attribute because those users have the same selling role. Only the Brand Administrators can update selling roles on a brand via the [Manage selling accounts](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/brg/selling-benefits?view=overview) tool in the Brand Registry portal.
  * If two or more authorized users of a brand contribute to the same ASIN attribute, Amazon's automatic system may choose which information should be displayed based on the contributing parties sales volume, refund rate, buyer feedback, A-to-z claims etc. Find more information on [Suggest changes to your product detail page](/gp/help/G200335450). We encourage authorized users of a brand to collaborate with the brand Administrator to determine the most appropriate information to display to avoid any confusion.
  * Amazon won't mediate between authorized users to decide the displayed contribution for a given ASIN, nor will it disclose information about the users who have the displayed contribution. This includes, but isn’t limited to, seller names, seller IDs, merchant tokens, and email addresses.
  * Contributions made by an authorized user to a Brand Registry branded ASIN can't be edited by the Selling Partner Support team. If you believe that there's incorrect information on a product detail page, refer to [Account Health - Report Abuse](/abuse-submission/index.html) to submit the relevant information.
