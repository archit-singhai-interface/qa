##

In many product categories, you have the option of supplying a reference
price, such as a **List Price** (for example, a Manufacturer's Suggested
Retail Price or MSRP). Reference prices are displayed in several places,
including on product detail pages and in search results for your products, to
show savings to customers.

  * The List Price you provide should represent the price at which you, or other retailers or sellers, have recently made or intend to make substantial sales of the product in question.
  * You also are responsible for ensuring that the reference prices you provide to us remain current.

If you do not have a ready-to-provide List Price, a possible value could be
the first price at which you offered or will offer the product. You can also
provide a value of 0 to indicate you do not have a List Price. If Amazon
cannot verify your List Price, we might not use it.

## Other reference prices

A **Was Price** is automatically computed and changes over time. The **Was
Price** is determined using the 90-day median price paid by customers for the
product on Amazon.. We exclude prices paid by customers for the product during
a limited time deal.

For more information on how to add list prices or what values to provide, go
to [Show a reference price on your products by proving a List
Price](/gp/help/G27XM55CQM3SBMD2).
