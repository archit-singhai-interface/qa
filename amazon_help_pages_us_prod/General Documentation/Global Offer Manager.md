On the Global Offer Manager dashboard, you can see the status of all your
offers across marketplaces. Go to [Build International Listings](/global-
selling/listings/connect) to access the dashboard.

Click the marketplace tabs on the left side of the page to see offer status
summaries: **Active** , **Needs your attention** , and **Ineligible**.

  * Review each marketplace summary.
  * Follow the instructions listed to create active offers.
  * Take bulk action across marketplaces to eliminate repeat work.

When a single action affects offers in multiple marketplaces, we notify you in
the tool.

## Create active offers

To activate out-of-stock offers, update the inventory quantity (for self-
fulfilled orders) or send us your inventory (for Amazon-fulfilled orders).

To activate offers for products that require approval, go to [Selling
applications](/hz/myqdashboard) and submit a request. Start by running a **New
application** search at the top of the page.

If your offer is for a product that does not exist in the target marketplace
catalog, you may need to create the product detail page first.

Amazon has automated a process to create product detail pages. If any of your
products are already in the translation queue, you will see an **In progress**
indicator.

If Amazon is not translating product detail pages for you, you will need to
create the detail pages yourself. Within Global Offer Manager, we provide a
downloadable file so that you can gather any missing attributes and work with
service providers to translate the content. Finally, we direct you to the
target marketplace catalog, so you can upload the completed file.
