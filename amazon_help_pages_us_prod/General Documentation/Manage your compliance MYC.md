If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

The Manage your compliance dashboard allows you to upload and manage product
compliance documents one at a time or through bulk uploads, and manage,
submit, track, and complete safety and regulatory requirements in one place.

On the dashboard, you can see:

  * The required compliance documentation for your products 
  * For each product with compliance requirements, the product name and image, the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN), and the Stock Keeping Unit number (SKU)
  * Under “Compliance requirements,” the specific documents or information required for each product, and in the next column, the date by which they must be provided
  * The approval status for any documentation or information you’ve submitted

## Submit information

To submit documents or appeal a compliance requirement, go to [Submit
compliance documents or appeal a documentation
request](/gp/help/GC35Z63FGCUCUWXX).
