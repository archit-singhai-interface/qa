Variations (also known as parent-child relationships) are sets of products
that are related to one another. Good variation relationship listings allow
buyers to compare and choose products based on different attributes such as
size, color, or other characteristics from the available options on a single
product detail page.

There are 3 elements of a parent-child relationship:  

  1. **The parent product** : The product displayed in the search results
  2. **The child products** : The products that are related to each parent product
  3. **The variation theme** : The relationship between the parent and the child

## The parent product

The parent product is a non-buyable product used to relate child products. The
Amazon catalog uses the parent product to establish relationships between the
child products. For example, if two shirts have the same parent then they are
related and are considered child products.

## The child products

The child product is an instance of the parent product. You can have many
child products that are all related to one parent product. Each child varies
in some way, for example, variation by size or by color.

## The variation theme

The variation theme defines how related products differ from each other. For
example, in the Clothing, Accessories & Luggage categories, child products can
differ from each other by size or color.

You can also use hybrid variation themes. For example, the Clothing,
Accessories & Luggage categories supports variations by both size and color,
so you can use "SizeColor" as a variation theme. See the valid values tab in
the inventory file for your specific category to see which types of
relationships it supports.

## Examples

The images below show a product with size and color variations. The parent
product is a t-shirt with no size or color product details. When a customer
views the detail page, they see the child attributes of color and size.
