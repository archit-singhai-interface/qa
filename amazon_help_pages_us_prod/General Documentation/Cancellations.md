If you are unable to ship an order, or if a buyer asks you to cancel an order,
refer to the following help topics:

  * [Cancel an item, order, or multiple orders](/help/hub/reference/G200198080) \- Cancel any unshipped item or order from your **Manage Orders** page.
  * [Order cancellations](/help/hub/reference/G201722390) \- Process cancellation requests from buyers.
  * [Cancellations FAQ](/help/hub/reference/GRXAS2XTAYEF77BG) \- Find solutionsto buyer cancellations, Pending status, or solve mistakes in cancelling.

Canceled orders are listed on the **Manage Orders** page. This page provides
basic details about canceled orders. No action is necessary on canceled
orders.

Canceled orders are complete when the **Pending status** is resolved. While
some orders are canceled by a buyer before they entering the processing stage,
other orders are canceled by Amazon after hours or days of processing. You
will not be able to communicate with a buyer once their order is canceled. If
the buyer has questions after their order is canceled, direct them to Amazon
customer service.
