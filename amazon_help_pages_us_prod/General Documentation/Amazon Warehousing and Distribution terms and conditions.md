Amazon Warehousing and Distribution ("AWD" or "program") provides upstream,
low-cost storage and distribution services for your inventory. These terms and
conditions supplement the [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/help/G1791) ("BSA") and govern your participation in AWD

  

  1. **Product eligibility:** AWD is available only for products that meet the [AWD product eligibility requirements](/gp/help/GGTMT4PTMUMHDS6B), which are subject to change at any time.
  2. **AWD shipment requirements:** All AWD shipments are subject to the following requirements:  

    1. **Shipping and routing requirements:** Your shipments must comply with:
       * [Send shipments to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD) requirements](/gp/help/GTPL7PGKU7WUKJSW)
       * [FBA LTL, FTL, and FCL deliveries requirements](/gp/help/200978400)
       * [Floor Loading Policy](/gp/help/200978440)
       * [FBA shipping and routing requirements](/gp/help/200141510), except the requirement to apply an FBA label to each box. For AWD box labeling requirements, follow the [Send shipments to AWD requirements](/gp/help/GTPL7PGKU7WUKJSW).
    2. **Shipments not supported:**
       * AWD only supports the shipment types identified on the [Send shipments to Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD): Confirm shipping](/gp/help/GQ6ZR5KNWKRBPT4M) page. Amazon is not responsible for lost or rejected shipments that do not comply with that page.
       * AWD sites can only receive inventory intended for AWD. You must not send FBA shipments meant to be received at an Amazon fulfillment center to an AWD site or send AWD shipments to an Amazon fulfillment center. You also must not consolidate FBA and AWD shipments in a single truckload. Amazon is not responsible for lost or rejected shipments if FBA and AWD shipments are in the same truckload or for shipments sent to the wrong site type.
    3. **Packaging and prep requirements:**
       * AWD shipments must comply with the destination channel’s packaging and prep requirements at the individual unit level. For inventory with both FBA and Multi-Channel Distribution ("MCD") as destination channels or only FBA as a destination channel, follow [FBA Packaging and prep requirements](/gp/help/G200141500). Amazon is not responsible for any downstream charges that you may incur due to incorrect packaging.
    4. **Product unit labeling:**
       * AWD does not provide product unit labeling services or relabeling services to fix labels on individual units. You are responsible for ensuring that units are labeled in compliance with the destination channel’s labeling requirements, including for FBA. Amazon is not responsible for lost or rejected units that do not have the correct unit labeling.
       * When creating an AWD shipment, you can choose to use the [FBA Label Service](/gp/help/200483750) for FBA products enrolled in the program. The FBA Label Service fees will be shown in your AWD shipment creation workflow but will not be charged until the units are received and labeled at an Amazon fulfillment center.
  3. **Fees**
     * **Fee types:** AWD charges the types of fees described below. For the current rates, go to the [program page](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/asdn/about?ref=esp_asdn#learn-service) in Seller Central.  

       1. **Storage fees** are charged once per month for your storage of inventory at AWD sites. We calculate these fees based on the applicable rate for the services used and daily usage on a per-cubic-foot basis. Monthly storage fees will appear on your Seller Central account during the month following their accrual.
       2. **Processing fees** cover all inbound and outbound handling activities related to your units while in AWD sites. Such processing fees will appear on your Seller Central Payments dashboard once your shipment arrives at an Amazon fulfillment center or other channels via MCD.
       3. **Transportation fees** are charged per-cubic-foot when your AWD units are transported to an Amazon fulfillment center or other channels via MCD. Transportation fees will appear on your Seller Central Payments dashboard once your shipment arrives at an Amazon fulfillment center or other channels via MCD.
  4. **Reimbursements:**   

    1. Eligibility: For a unit to be eligible for reimbursement under this section, all of the following must be true: 
       * The ASIN is present in your inventory catalog at the time it is lost or damaged.
       * There was a valid AWD appointment for the shipment the unit was sent in.
       * The unit complies with the AWD product eligibility requirements and with the AWD shipment requirements described in these terms and conditions.
       * You have sent us the exact units and quantities stated in your shipping plan.
       * The unit was shipped via a supported shipping method as identified on the AWD program page (except that this eligibility criteria does not apply if Amazon confirms it received a unit shipped via an unsupported method but then subsequently loses or damages it in the AWD facility).
       * The shipment for the unit is not in canceled or deleted status.
       * The unit is not defective.
       * When a lost or damaged unit claim is filed, under review, and during any appeals, your account must be in normal status.
    2. **AWD fee reimbursement for box dimensions:** This provision applies to the reimbursement of AWD storage and transportation fees that we determine were charged using inaccurate box dimensions. This provision does not apply to fee types besides AWD storage and transportation fees. If we confirm that AWD storage and transportation fees were charged using inaccurate dimensions, we will reimburse you the difference between the fees as charged and the fees based on the corrected measurements. If the dimensions that you provide vary from our verified measurement, our measurement will govern. A box is not eligible for a remeasurement request if the box has already been remeasured twice in the past 60 days, or if there are no available boxes of that MSKU at an AWD site.
       * **Claim window:**
         * You must submit your request within 90 days of the date on which the fee was charged. Claims submitted outside of this window are not eligible for reimbursement.
       * **Submitting a claim:**
         * **Before submitting a claim,** review the dimension data in your [fee reports](/awd/fee/reporting) and determine whether the dimensions used in the fee calculation are different from what you expected.
         * If you have reviewed the dimension data in a fee report and you still believe it is inaccurate, contact [Amazon Selling Partner Support](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/support/describe?ref_ASSR) or your account manager and open a research request.
         * Amazon will only accept one claim per fee charge. Additional claims for the same fee charge will be declined.
         * After we review your request, we will notify you if you are eligible for reimbursement.
    3. **AWD inventory reimbursement:** If a unit you send to us as part of the program is lost or damaged at an AWD facility or by a carrier operated by Amazon or on behalf of Amazon through the program, we will replace that unit with a new unit of the same FNSKU or we will reimburse you for it. If your unit is eligible under this section and we haven’t already reimbursed you, you can file a reimbursement claim by submitting a case to [Selling Partner Support](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/center). Amazon will only accept one lost or damaged shipment claim per shipment and one AWD facility operations claim per box. Additional claims for the same shipment or box will be declined.
       * **Lost or damaged shipments:** : When filing a claim for lost or damaged shipments, you must follow these provisions of the [FBA inventory reimbursement policy: Shipment to Amazon claims](/gp/help/GEYPWTSQRTXXXMVB): 
         * You must provide the information and documents described in the "Submit your Claim" section, and we may ask you to provide additional information.
         * You must submit your claim within the specified claim window for lost or damaged shipments in the FBA inventory reimbursement policy, with the claim window starting on the verified date that the shipment was delivered to an AWD site or to a third-party facility operated on Amazon’s behalf. Claims submitted outside this window are not eligible for reimbursement.
       * **AWD facility operations:** When filing a claim for units lost or damaged by an AWD facility, you must submit your claim within the claim window specified in the [FBA inventory reimbursement policy: Fulfillment center operations claims](/gp/help/GGEV4254LJJ9BAEG), with the claim window starting on the date that the unit was identified by Amazon as lost or damaged. Claims submitted outside this window are not eligible for reimbursement.
       * **AWD transportation:** Units that are lost or damaged in transit to an Amazon fulfillment center will be replaced or reimbursed pursuant to the [FBA inventory reimbursement policy](/gp/help/external/G200213130?ref=efph_G200213130_cont_521&locale=en-US). For units that are lost or damaged in transit to other channels via MCD, you must submit your claim within the window specified in the [FBA inventory reimbursement policy: Removals claims](/gp/help/external/G9ZB3H4DP4H72U6R). Claims submitted outside this window are not eligible for reimbursement.
       * **Inventory reimbursement calculation:** If we determine that your AWD inventory reimbursement claim is valid, we will reimburse you according to the valuation methodology described in the [FBA inventory reimbursement policy](/gp/help/200213130).
  5. **Returns to You and Disposal:** You may, at any time, request that units be returned to you by submitting a request through our MCD service and providing a return shipping address. Standard MCD fees will apply.  

    1. We may with notice return units to you, and you must provide a designated shipping address for the returned units. If you fail to do so, or if we cannot make arrangements for you to pay for the return shipment via MCD, then the units will be deemed abandoned and we may elect to dispose of them as appropriate based on the inventory (for example, by selling, donating, or recycling them) and retain any proceeds we may receive from the disposal. We may dispose of any unit (and you will be deemed to have consented to our action) immediately if we determine that (i) the unit creates a safety, health, or liability risk to Amazon, our personnel, or any third party; (ii) you have engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity; or (iii) we have cause to terminate your use of Services with immediate effect pursuant to Section 3 of the BSA and are exposed to liability toward a third party.
    2. You will promptly notify us of any recalls, potential recalls, or safety alerts of any of your products and cooperate and assist us in connection with any recalls or safety alerts, including by initiating the procedures for returning items to you via MCD. You will be responsible for all costs and expenses you, we or any of our or your Affiliates incur in connection with any recall or potential recall or safety alerts of any of your products (including the costs to return, store, repair, liquidate, or deliver to you or any vendor any of these products).
  6. **Compliance with these terms and conditions:** Failure to comply with these terms and conditions may result in the refusal of inventory at the AWD facility, disposal or return of inventory, blocking of future shipments, unplanned charges, and penalties up to and including account suspension and termination.
