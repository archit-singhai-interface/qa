As a Maker, your handmade Home Decor, Furniture, Kitchen & Dining products
must adhere to the following guidelines:

  * All products must adhere to [Amazonâ€™s general policies and agreements](/gp/help/G521).
  * All products must adhere to the [Category, product, and listing restrictions](/gp/help/G200301050).
  * All products must meet the overall [Amazon Handmade: Category Listing Policies & Requirements](/gp/help/GNGMMFQ5FPLJFBJP).
  * We permit use of hand tools and light machinery; machinery should be used by you in your home studio or workspace.
  * We will allow you to hand alter pre-made items; for example, we will allow you to apply your own designs via these approved processes: screen printing, press printing, or heat transfer.
  * Custom vinyl and stickers are permitted as long as they are original designs, created by you in your studio.
  * Unauthorized copies or reproductions of artwork that violate any copyright or trademark are not allowed. Read more about [Intellectual Property for Rights Owners](/gp/help/GU5SQCEKADDAQRLZ).
