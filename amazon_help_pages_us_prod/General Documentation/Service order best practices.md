In an effort to offer the best buyer and provider experience possible, Amazon
highly recommends providers follow five main practices when handling a service
order.

With these practices, you can properly document the original conditions of the
product or service site, which serve as a reference for Happiness Guarantee
claims, charge backs, or any performance related inquiry. Following these
practices does not automatically guarantee or resolve appeals for performance
metrics; they serve as a backup for your actions or agreements with buyers.

##  At the service location

  

  1. **Examine the products:** Right before starting service, make sure that the products needed are in an optimal condition and all parts are included. Do this step in the presence of the buyer. If a service will not be successful due to missing or damaged parts, put parts back in box and arrange a reschedule or cancellation of the order based on your and buyerâ€™s availability.
  2. **Review the instruction manual, if present and applicable.**
  3. Sometimes a **defective product** is only noticed after the completion of the service. When this happens, **consider the following practices** :
     * Notify the Customer: explain why and how the item is malfunctioning, and what is needed in order to fix it.
     * Document: after discussing the situation with the Customer, e-mail the Customer through the Buyer-Seller Messaging service confirming the actions that will be taken. You can take pictures and/or video if authorized by the Customer.
     * Do not mark the order as complete: [contact us](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/contact-us/contact-amazon-form.html?ref=xx_contactus_foot_%5e) for guidance on next steps and to report the situation.
  4. **Check scope of work completion and quality** with the Customer after finishing the job and before collecting the signature.
  5. **Document your job:** Write a summary of the results under **Job Notes** on an order level, you can also use Buyer-Seller Messages to send a summary to the Customer. Make sure you cover all relevant aspects of the product condition, safety concerns, product placement, advice and other agreements with the buyer.
