If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## Button cell and coin batteries covered by this policy

This policy includes standalone button cell and coin batteries, which are
flat, round single-cell batteries, typically 5 to 25 mm in diameter, ranging
in height from 1 to 6 mm, as well as consumer products with button cell or
coin batteries.

Button and coin batteries can be sold as stand-alone batteries, but they are
also used in a broad range of consumer and household products. Button
batteries are often powered by alkaline, silver oxide, or zinc air, and have a
lower rated voltage, typically ranging from 1 to 5 volts. Coin batteries are
powered by lithium, rated at 3 volts, and tend to be larger in diameter than
button batteries.

## Our policy for button cell and coin batteries

We require that all button cell and coin batteries have been tested to and
comply with the regulations, standards, and requirements listed below:
