You can delete any number of products from a Prime Exclusive Discount. There
are two ways to do this:

  * Deleting products directly from the web app
  * Uploading an Excel spreadsheet with SKUs to be deleted

## Delete SKUs from a discount before scheduling

Go to **Prime Exclusive Discount** and choose **View details** from the action
cell that corresponds to the discount you want to edit. If you have uploaded
products, then you will be directed to the **Review** page. Click **Remove
product** for the product that you want to delete.

## Inline delete for a submitted discount

Go to the **Prime Exclusive Discount** page and choose **View details** from
the action cell that corresponds to the discount that you want to edit. Once
the discount details open up, click **Delete** for the product that you want
to remove. You will be directed to the **Review** page. Confirm the deletion
by clicking **Submit discounts**.

## Bulk delete

Go to the **Prime Exclusive Discount** page and choose **View details** from
the action cell that corresponds to the discount that you want to edit. Once
the discount details open up, click **Add more products**. Upload the discount
upload template spreadsheet that you filled out with the SKUs that you want to
delete, and make sure that the **add-edit-delete** column displays "d". Submit
the products in the **Review** page.

**Note:** It can take up to two hours for the discounted price to be removed
from the detail page. In rare circumstances, updates may be delayed for up to
24 hours due to system latency.
