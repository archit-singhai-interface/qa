The [FBA dashboard](/fba/dashboard/) provides a summarized view of your FBA
business, including sales, shipments, inventory, and FBA opportunities. Weâ€™ve
also created a centralized navigation system that groups your most critical
inventory-management pages together, allowing you to navigate between them
more easily.

Watch our video for an overview, and read more information below.

aged inventory surcharge and the estimated fee amount as of the next charge
date, assuming no further sales. Aged inventory will incur additional fees.

details and take action to reduce aged inventory.

#### Storage utilization ratio

This card shows your storage utilization ratio, which is the ratio of your
average daily inventory volume stored divided by the average daily shipped
volume over the past 13 weeks. Storage utilization ratio is used to determine
the rate for storage utilization surcharge, which is a surcharge on top of the
base monthly storage fee.
