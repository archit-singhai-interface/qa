A seller fee is charged for price discounts that you run in the US during
high-velocity sales events, such as Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days, as a
cost of the promotion merchandising benefit.

**Note:** Price discounts that run during non-event days will not be charged a
fee.

Price discounts that run during high-velocity sales events can provide you
with significant value, such as merchandising capabilities, badging, and
savings summaries that display in search results and on product detail pages.
The [Price Discounts tool](/discounts) uses badges to highlight products
during the most highly trafficked events in order to increase customer traffic
and conversion rates.

## Fee amount

A $50 fee will be charged for each price discount thatâ€™s created and run
during high-velocity sales events in the US. You will be invoiced for this fee
after the promotion ends and after a 10-day reconciliation period. This fee
will show as a **Promotion fee** in the [Payments
report](/payments/dashboard). We only charge the fee if at least one
discounted unit sold during the event.
