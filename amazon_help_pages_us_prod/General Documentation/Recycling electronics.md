**Important:** If you supply products for sale on Amazon, you must comply with
all federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to those
products and product listings.

Certain electronic products contain potentially hazardous materials, such as
lead and mercury, that can pose a risk to human health and the environment if
not properly managed. Some states also ban electronic products from landfills
or incinerators. Amazon supports the responsible disposal and recycling of
electronics products.

## Amazon Devices

Amazon device recycling options can be found by visiting our recycling program
page by following this link: [Amazon Device
Recycle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200197550).

Amazon recognizes the importance of recycling electronic equipment at the end
of its useful life, which is why we support the responsible disposal and
recycling of electronics products and offer a recycling program for electronic
items including Amazon devices and selected accessories. In some areas, the
disposal of rechargeable batteries and certain electronic devices is
regulated, so please make sure you dispose of Amazon devices, accessories,
batteries and other regulated electronic devices in accordance with your local
laws and regulations.

Customers can find more information about electronics recycling options and
state-specific requirements on the following websites:
