Amazon limits the addition of new sellers in the Industrial & Scientific
category to ensure that customers are able to buy with confidence from all
sellers on Amazon.

The selling guidelines listed here for selling in the Industrial & Scientific
category reflect buyer concern for product quality, product branding, and
consumer safety. Adherence to import and export restrictions is also important
to ensuring that buyers can purchase authentic, high-quality Industrial &
Scientific products.

##  Category requirements

  * Sellers must have an active Professional selling plan. Learn more about [Seller account features](/gp/help/64491).
  * Sellers must conduct proper research to ensure that their Industrial & Scientific product listings comply with applicable local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations.
  * All products must meet North America product safety standards. For more information, visit the [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission](http://www.cpsc.gov) and [Health Canada's Consumer Product Safety resources](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/index-eng.php).
  * Sellers should only list Industrial & Scientific Supplies in the Industrial & Scientific Category. Listing of products that are not Industrial or Scientific supplies will result in removal of seller approval to list in this category.

##  Product listing
