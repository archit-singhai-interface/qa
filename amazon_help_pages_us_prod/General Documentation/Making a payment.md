**Note:** The Balance Repayments page is currently unavailable. To ensure that
any balance due on your account can be charged automatically, update the
credit card details on the [Charge
Methods](/sw/AccountInfo/ChargeMethod/step/View) page.

You can use Make a Payment to pay the seller account balance that you owe. You
might have this type of balance if your sales for a settlement period were
less than your fees and charges, and Amazon was unable to charge a credit card
on file for your seller account. Fees and charges can include monthly
subscription fees and order refunds.

If you have a negative balance, a **Repay Balance** will appear in the
**Closing Balance** section of your [Payments summary](/gp/payments-
account/settlement-summary.html). Click this button to make a payment. To see
the credits and charges that were applied to your account for specific
periods, select the date range in the **Statement View** page, or [download
the statement](/gp/payments-account/past-settlements.html) for that period.

**Note:** If the payment fails to go through when you submit payment, clear
out your browser cache, restart your browser, and then attempt payment again.

##  Pay with a credit card

Make a Payment will charge your payment to the credit card that was set up in
your account, or you can select a different card from the drop-down list
before making the payment. To make a payment with a new card, follow these
steps to add it to your seller account. Then return to Make a Payment and
select the new card.

  

  1. On the **Settings** drop-down menu of the seller account, select **Account Info**.
  2. In the **Payment Information** section, click **Charge Methods**.
  3. In the **Charge Method** box, click **Edit** on the right side.
  4. Select or add a new card, making sure that you enter the requested information exactly as it appears on your credit card statement.

**Note:** For amounts you owe us, Amazon may charge any payment instrument you
provide to us.

##  Make a partial payment

To make a partial payment, select **Other Amount** and enter the amount you
want to pay. Partial payments are applied to your balance in the order in
which the charges were incurred, with the oldest charge first.
