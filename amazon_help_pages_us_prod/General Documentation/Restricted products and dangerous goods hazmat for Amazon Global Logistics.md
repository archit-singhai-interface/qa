is listed as an **Example of Permitted Listings** , all products and listings
must also comply with applicable laws. For more information, see [Restricted

## Dangerous goods

Dangerous goods (also called hazmat) are regulated substances or materials
that may pose a risk during storing, handling, or transporting because they
contain flammable, pressurized, corrosive, or otherwise harmful substances.
“Dangerous goods” **also refers to consumer products** such as laptops,
smartphones, household cleaners, spray paints, and cosmetics.

Amazon Global Logistics **prohibits** all dangerous goods **except** these
Section II lithium batteries:

  * **UN3481** for 1) packing instruction (PI) 966 lithium ion batteries packed with equipment and 2) PI 967 lithium ion batteries contained in equipment 
  * **UN3091** for 1) PI 969 lithium metal batteries packed with equipment and 2) PI 970 lithium metal batteries contained in equipment

Note that standalone lithium ion batteries (UN3480) and lithium metal
batteries (UN3090) are prohibited. Amazon also reserves the right to reject
certain products, even if they fall into the above categories. For more
information, see [Requirements for lithium batteries or products that ship
with lithium batteries](/gp/help/200383420).

The following transport labels and marks are required for Amazon Global
Logistics ocean and air freight:

for information only.

## Additional dangerous goods information

Some products that are regulated as dangerous goods do not require warning
labels or phrases (for example, cosmetics and speakers containing magnetized
material). A product without labels or warnings **might still be categorized
and regulated as a dangerous good**.
