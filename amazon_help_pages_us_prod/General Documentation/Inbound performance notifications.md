In addition to alerts and feedback in Seller Central, Amazon sends email
notifications about shipment issues.We typically send one notification per
problem type for each shipment with issues.

For example, three of your shipments arrive at a fulfillment center on the
same day, and there are issues with two of them.

  * The first shipment has five items with unscannable labels. This generates one notification.
  * The second shipment has one unscannable label and one item that was missing a label. This generates two notificationsâ€”one for the unscannable label and one for the missing label.

The notification includes the shipment name, number, and date of receipt. We
also provide a link to the [shipping queue](/gp/fba/inbound-queue/index.html),
so you can review the problem details.

## Performance alert notification details

For product-level performance alerts, we typically send a notification for
each product subject to shipment creation suspension. The notification
summarizes problems we have identified with that product in the previous 90
days, along with the quantity of items affected. We also provide a link to the
affected shipment's Problem Summary page, so you can review the details and
acknowledge the problem.

For shipment-level performance alerts, you receive a single email informing
you that your shipment abilities are suspended. The notification includes the
shipment ID, the problems encountered, and a link to the Problem Summary page.

**Note:** All email notifications are "On" by default.

To turn off the alerts:

  

  1. On the Seller Central home page, go to **Settings** and select **Notification Preferences**. 
  2. Click **Edit** to the right of [Order Notifications](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/notifications/preferences).
  3. De-select **Inbound Shipment Problem Notifications** and **Save**.
