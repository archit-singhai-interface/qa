This page shows the amount paid out in each settlement period to your account
and the status of your funds.

We report the status in four stages:  

  1. Scheduled Payout: Your funds are scheduled for disbursement following the close of settlement group.
  2. Processing: Your funds are being processed by Amazon financial systems.
  3. Sent to bank: Amazon has sent the fund transfer request to its partner bank.
  4. Acknowledged by bank: Amazon’s partner bank has confirmed that fund transfer request has been sent to your selected bank.

Once “Acknowledged by bank”, it can take up to 5 business days for funds to
appear in your bank account. The Federal ACH Trace ID can be used by your
bank’s ACH specialist to trace funds, that have not appeared in your bank
account after 5 business days from the time that the transfer is initiated.

**Note:** If a disbursement fails, funds will be carried over into the next
settlement period for transfer to your bank.
