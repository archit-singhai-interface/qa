FBA Grade and Resell allows you to recover value on unfulfillable inventory by
having Amazon grade and relist eligible items as **Used** , instead of
returning, removing or disposing the inventory.

When you submit an item, Amazon evaluates the condition and creates the
listing on your behalf, with you as the seller on record. You set the price
and manage the listing, just like you would for your current new and used
items.

## How it works

**Overview: enrollment, grading, and listing**

  * You can enroll in FBA Grade and Resell from your [Automated unfulfillable settings](/recoveryui/removal-setting/automated-unfulfillable).
  * Eligible customer returns that are unsellable as **New** are processed through different evaluation paths based on the type of product. These paths include non-technical, technical, and specialty grading. For products like computers or cameras, the advanced grading includes factory reset, memory wiping, and functionality testing.

**Note:** All customer returns go through a standard evaluation process to
determine if their products are sellable (as **New**) or unsellable (as
**New**). FBA Grade and Resell is only for unfulfillable inventory already
deemed unsellable as **New**.

  * Unsellable (as **New**) items are graded and assigned one of [four conditions](/gp/help/200339950): **Used–Like New** , **Used–Very Good** , **Used–Good** , and **Used–Acceptable or graded as Unsellable**.
  * At the time of relisting, a processing fee is applied to items graded as **Like New** , **Very Good** , **Good** , and **Acceptable**. No processing fee will apply for items graded as **Unsellable**. These items will move to your unfulfillable inventory for removal.
  * Once items are submitted to the program, grading and relisting can take up to two weeks.  However, this process may take longer during holiday seasons.
  * A SKU is generated for your used listing with a unique identifier, under the parent ASIN, based on graded condition and type of defect. The item is priced in line with your pricing rules in your [Automated unfulfillable settings](/recoveryui/removal-setting/automated-unfulfillable), which you configure when you enroll in the program and can update at any time.

**Overview: inventory management, sales, and online customer experience**

  * Manage your used listings with existing processes. Manage [pricing](/gp/help/PTFQ566449VXXCP), [advertising](/gp/help/G200663330), and [sales](/gp/help/G202142130) just like you do for your new items.
  * Customers can access your **Used** listings from the following:
    * Search results, when they click to view all **New and Used offers** under **More buying choices**
    * The product detail page of the parent ASIN either through the **Used featured offer** , if your used listing is the Featured Offer, or by clicking to view all **New and Used offers**
  * **Used** listings include the condition of the listing, such as **Used–Like New**. Condition notes within the listing indicate item and package defects or damage where applicable, including whether the item was repackaged.

**Note:** You are the seller on record for all listings generated by the
program and these listings are only eligible to be the **Used featured
offer**. The listing doesn’t affect the **New featured offer** for the parent
ASIN.

Listings that are sold by Amazon fulfillment centers are not part of FBA Grade
and Resell and are sourced as part of the [FBA inventory reimbursement
policy](/gp/help/G200213130).

  * You receive payouts minus fees for your sold Grade and Resell units just as you would for your sold **New** and **Used** offers. You can view this information on your [Payments dashboard](/payments/dashboard/index.html).

By participating in this program, you agree to the [FBA Grade and Resell terms
and conditions](/gp/help/GPNQFGFCRUJQ2EY4).

## Fees

The Grade and Resell fee is a flat per-unit processing fee based on the size
and weight of the item. The processing fee is applied at the time of
relisting. If your item is graded as **Unsellable** , no processing fee will
be charged. You’re eligible for fee adjustments if you were incorrectly
charged a fee due to misclassification of the size or item weight.

**Processing fee**

| Size | Item weight | Fee  
---|---|---|---  
[Standard-size items](/gp/help/G201105770) | Small standard-size | 16 oz or less | $1.50  
Large standard-size | 21 lb or less | $1.80  
[Oversize and special handling items](/gp/help/G201105770) | Small/medium oversize | 151 lb or less | $2.65  
Large/special oversize | Over 151 lb  | $4.10

* _You determine the used-item price by configuring discount percentages when enrolling in the program. The initial list price for a used item is calculated from your pre-defined discount percentages multiplied by the new listing price. The discounts in this example are only for illustration and are not recommendations for discount percentages._

**Tracking processing fees**

Processing fees information can be found in the [Payments
dashboard](/payments/dashboard/index.html) in the following views and reports:  

  1. **Statement view** : Under **FBA fees** as part of **Other** transactions
  2. **Transaction view** : The transaction type for processing fees will be shown as **Grade and Resell fees**. At this time, it's not possible to filter on this transaction type, but it will appear as part of the dashboard interface and when you download the report.
  3. **All statements** : In the downloaded report, processing fees will be shown with a transaction type of **Grade and Resell fees** and a corresponding “Grade and Resell charge” note for the amount type.
  4. **Date range reports** :
     * **Transaction report** : Under the **Others** transaction type with a corresponding “Grade and Resell Charge” note for description 
     * **Monthly summary report** : Under **Other transaction fees**
     * **Custom summary report** : Under **Other transaction fees**

**Note:** "Other" transactions in the statement view and date range reports
will include other fees not charged by the program.

When a Grade and Resell unit is being evaluated, [inventory storage
fees](/gp/help/200612770) cease to accrue for that unit. For items graded as
**Used** , the clock restarts on the aged-inventory surcharge and monthly
storage fees after your item is listed. For items graded as **Unsellable** ,
standard Amazon storage fees will apply after the item is returned to your
unfulfillable inventory.

## Product eligibility

Eligibility for FBA Grade and Resell is restricted to customer-returned FBA
inventory located in fulfillment centers that are enabled for this program.
More centers will be enabled in the future.

Eligibility is also subject to legal, safety, regulatory, and other
guidelines, and is restricted to customer-returned FBA inventory located in
fulfillment centers that are enabled for this program. More centers will be
enabled in the future. Ineligible products include the following:

  * Heavy and bulky items
  * Products that have historically generated low feedback ratings

##  Submit and manage your inventory

**Note:** Effective March 21, 2022, Amazon no longer accepts manual removal
orders for Grade and Resell.

## Step 1: Submit your unfulfillable inventory

You can submit inventory automatically through **Automated unfulfillable
settings** :

  * From the **Settings** menu, select [Fulfillment by Amazon](/fba/settings).
  * On the FBA settings page, scroll down to [Automated unfulfillable settings](/recoveryui/removal-setting/automated-unfulfillable).
  * Click **Edit**.

**Note:** If you don’t have the right permissions to view these settings, open
the **Inventory** menu, select **FBA Inventory** , and click **Go back to
manage FBA inventory**. Go to **Remove unfulfillable inventory** and then
click **Auto removal settings**.

  * On the Automated unfulfillable settings page, select **Enable** , and then **Grade and Resell**.
  * To set the percentage discount based on the item’s condition, select **Update your price**. You can update the price at any time, but note that the discount only applies when the listing is first created.
  * For items that you don’t want graded and resold, click **Enter one or more ASINs to exclude**.

**Note:** At this time, you can only exclude a maximum of 2,000 ASINs. Click
**Update** at the bottom of the page to save your changes.

Eligible customer-returned units that are not excluded by you and located in
an enabled fulfillment center will then be automatically enrolled in the FBA
Grade and Resell program. You can only submit units to Grade and Resell
through the automated settings; new units cannot be added through restocking
or manual removal orders. You will receive an error message if you create a
shipment to replenish a Grade and Resell SKU.

## Step 2: Amazon grades your inventory

After you submit your FBA Grade and Resell inventory, we’ll grade your item
and assign a condition. Here’s how it works:

  * A returns specialist completes a multi-point inspection process that is tailored to the product category and based on the evaluation path, such as non-technical, technical, and specialty grading.
  * Depending on the product category and appropriate classification, grading may include the following: 
    * Catalog product detail versus physical item match
    * Product parts and accessories check
    * Seven-side product or package damage or cosmetic blemish check
      * Examples of damage types include cut or torn, bent or crushed, holes, customer information, stains, layers of tape, and writing.
    * Product usability or functionality validation based on product category
      * Examples of validation steps include plugging in cables, powering on devices, and testing outputs, settings, or different modes for functionality.
    * External product cleaning or internal memory wiping
    * Product re-packaging option validation
  * A proprietary algorithm determines the suitable condition: **Used–Like New** , **Used–Very Good** , **Used–Good** , and **Used–Acceptable** , based on our [condition guidelines](/gp/help/200339950). Items that don’t meet these guidelines are graded as **Unsellable** and remain in your unfulfillable inventory.
  * If the item is graded as **Used** , we'll [refurbish and repackage](/gp/help/G201505310) it for resale, as needed.

**Note:** Grading is the process Amazon uses to evaluate and determine the
condition of an item for relisting. [Amazon fulfillment
center](https://www.amazon.com/Warehouse-Deals/b?ie=UTF8&node=10158976011)
uses the same process to evaluate customer returns.

## Step 3: Track the status of graded inventory

To track the status of units that you’ve submitted for Grade and Resell
through removal orders, check your [Removal order detail
report](/reportcentral/REMOVAL_ORDER_DETAIL/0):

  * The **Requested qty** column shows the total number of items that you’ve submitted to the program. 
  * **Completed qty** shows units that have been graded.
  * Units that are still being graded appear under **In process qty**.

For units that you’ve submitted through automated unfulfillable settings,
track the status of graded items in the [Grade and Resell
report](/reportcentral/VALUE_RECOVERY/0). The report lists evaluated inventory
under the following columns: **Order ID** , **LPN** , **ASIN** , original and
program **FNSKU** , program-generated **MSKU** , **Used Condition** , **Unit
status** , and **Reason**.

**Note:** This report is a pre-sales report. The **Order ID** listed is the
order ID of the customer return order before submission to Grade and Resell.
For more information on how to track sales orders from Grade and Resell, go to
**Step 5**. For more information on **condition notes** , which outline
defects identified from the grading process, go to **Step 4**.

## Step 4: Price and manage your listings

Once an item is graded as **Used** , a SKU is generated for your newly
generated listing under the parent ASIN. In the Grade and Resell price
settings in [Automated unfulfillable settings](/recoveryui/removal-
setting/automated-unfulfillable), you can control the initial list price for
all ASINs submitted to the program based on the item’s used condition. The
initial price is a percentage of the listed price of the new item. Once the
listing is created, you can change the price at any time on [Manage
pricing](/inventory?viewId=PRICING).

All SKUs in Grade and Resell follow a standard naming format:

  * **[prefix]. [seller msku]-[defect identifier]-[suffix]** , where the prefix is always **amzn.gr**. Use this prefix to search for and track graded inventory.
  * The suffix will be one of the following: **LN** for Like New, **VG** for Very Good, **GD** for Good, or **AC** for Acceptable. The defect identifier will be randomized characters.
  * Total length of a generated SKU is 40 characters. We might truncate your seller MSKU if it exceeds 22 characters, or append additional randomized characters if your seller MSKU is less than 22 characters.

The listings appear in your [Inventory reports](/listing/reports). More than
one SKU could be generated in the same condition for a given parent ASIN if
the type of defect differs. If you are out-of-stock of a given SKU, we relist
any new units in the same condition with the same defect under that SKU. If
you manually delete a SKU because it is out-of-stock, we generate a new SKU as
needed based on evaluation results, but the SKU may end up stranded as a
result of the deletion.

**Note:** Similar to new inventory, Grade and Resell inventory may become
**stranded** , that is, inventory in a fulfillment center not associated with
an active offer and therefore not available for purchase. Stranded Grade and
Resell inventory can be resolved by changing the listed price or removing the
listing altogether. For an analysis of stranded units see the [Stranded
inventory report](/gp/help/G201835130).

Customers are able to view these listings online with the listing
**condition** and **condition notes** that are tailored to the SKU. You can
manage customer queries and ratings as you do for your new and used items.

To view the **condition notes** that are associated with your listings and
visible to customers, navigate to [Inventory reports](/listing/reports) and
follow the steps below:  

  1. On this page, select any of the following four **Report types** from the drop down: **Active listings report** , **Open listings report** , **Inactive listings Report** , or **All listings report**.
  2. Click **Customize the columns for this report** to customize the attributes shown.
  3. On the **Custom inventory reports** page, add the following attributes: **seller-sku, item-note** , and **item-condition** if they are not already present. Click **Save**.
  4. Return to the [Inventory reports](/listing/reports) page and click **Request report**.
  5. The column **item-note** in the downloaded report shows the associated condition notes.

Below are sample **condition notes** for different conditions that can vary
based on the item and evaluation results.

Item-condition | Item condition | item-note  
---|---|---  
1 | Like new | Item will come in original packaging.  
2 | Very good | Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.  
3 | Good | Small cosmetic imperfection on bottom or back of item. Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.  
4 | Acceptable | Large cosmetic imperfection on the corner of the item. Item will come repackaged.  
  
**Note:** Grade and Resell listings are only automatically priced once at the
point of listing based on your pre-set pricing rules. Your existing Grade and
Resell listing prices are not automatically updated when you change the price
of the parent ASIN through pricing or promotions actions. As more than one SKU
could be generated in the same condition for a given product, ensure that your
used prices stay synchronized as you make changes to your new prices.

**Example that compares initial list price for used items based on condition**

Condition | Recovery percentage 1 | New item price at time of relisting 2 | Initial list price of used item 3 | SKU example   
---|---|---|---|---  
Used–Like New | 95% | $50 | $47.50 | amzn.gr. [seller msku]-[defect identifier]- LN  
Used–Very Good | 85% | $42.50 | amzn.gr. [seller msku]-[defect identifier]- VG  
Used–Good | 80% | $40 | amzn.gr. [seller msku]-[defect identifier]- GD  
Used–Acceptable | 75% | $37.50 | amzn.gr. [seller msku]-[defect identifier]- AC  
  
1 You determine the recovery percentage based on the new item price. The
recovery percentages in this example are only for illustration and are not
recommendations.

2 FBA Grade and Resell pricing is calculated based on your new item prices,
which must comply with the [Amazon store fair pricing
policy](/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V).

3 Once you create used pricing tiers for a SKU, additional items of the same
SKU submitted to FBA Grade and Resell automatically have the initial price
applied.

## Step 5: Track sales orders and payments

FBA Grade and Resell sales data is available in [Fulfillment
reports](/reportcentral/WelcomePage):

  1. From the **Reports** tab, select **Fulfillment.**

  2. From the left navigation, scroll down to the **Sales** section and download either the [All orders](/reportcentral/FlatFileAllOrdersReport/1) report or the [Customer shipment sales](/reportcentral/SHIPMENT_SALES/1) report. Sales and order IDs from the program can be identified using the **amzn.gr** prefix.

Performance analytics are in the [FBA Grade and Resell
Analytics](/fbaselleranalytics/value-recovery) page and also available under
the main menu:

  1. Go to **Menu** and then **Inventory** > **Analytics**.

  2. Use the high-level metrics to track program performance.

Payout information is in the [Payments
dashboard](/payments/dashboard/index.html):

  1. From the **Reports** tab, select **Payments.**

  2. In [Transaction view](/payments/event/view), **Transaction type: Grade and Resell fees** represents charges for graded and listed inventory. At this time, it's not possible to filter on this transaction type, but it will appear as part of the dashboard interface and when you download the report.

  3. You can also select **Transaction type: order payment** for proceeds on all Amazon orders, including Grade and Resell orders. 

  4. Click **Download** to generate a report. 

[All statement](/payments/past-settlements) reports include more granular
details at the SKU level. You can identify Grade and Resell SKUs with the
**amzn.gr** prefix.

**Note:** Only the **Order IDs** associated with the **Transaction type: order
payment** are order IDs from program sales. The order IDs associated with
**Transaction type: Grade and Resell fees** mirror those in the [Grade and
Resell report](/reportcentral/VALUE_RECOVERY/0) for graded inventory and
represent the order IDs of the customer return orders before submission into
Grade and Resell.

There are currently no dedicated sales and inventory reports for Grade and
Resell. However, we plan to provide improved and dedicated sales and inventory
reporting for the program in the future.

## Step 6: After-sales: customer reviews and returns

FBA Grade and Resell customer product reviews roll up to the parent product if
they meet the [review
guidelines](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF),
just as they would for other products that you list, but do not have the same
impact on **Account Health Metrics** as new SKUs.

Customer product reviews or return comments that mention product quality or
defects will be excluded from Account Health ratings. Additionally, you can
also exclude any low-volume ASIN or ASINs you are concerned about in the ASIN
exclusion box on the [Automated unfulfillable settings](/recoveryui/removal-
setting/automated-unfulfillable) page.

**Note:** The feedback percentage based upon your **star ratings** is
calculated in the same manner as new products. For more information, learn
about how feedback and star ratings work.

Review select customer feedback on Grade and Resell SKUs, which can be
identified with the **amzn.gr** prefix, on the [Voice of the customer](/voice-
of-the-customer/) page. Additionally, seller feedback ratings received on all
orders, including orders with Grade and Resell units, are found on [Feedback
manager](/feedback-manager/index.html#/) at the **Order ID** level. For more
information on feedback moderation, go to [Can Amazon remove buyer
feedback?](/gp/help/G20231). You can appeal product review violations by using
the **Report abuse** link on the Amazon site near the content you want to
appeal or by emailing [community-help@amazon.com](mailto:community-
help@amazon.com) if there is no link.

Below are 10 sample product reviews with anecdotes from customers who bought
Grade and Resell units and gave a rating of 4+:

The [returns policy](/gp/help/200379860) is the same for FBA Grade and Resell
as it is for listings you manage. Any initiated customer returns appear on
[FBA customer returns](/reportcentral/CUSTOMER_RETURNS/0) as they do for other
offers listed by you. If a Grade and Resell unit is returned and is eligible
for re-enrollment based on your settings, the unit is automatically submitted
for re-grading. Otherwise it is returned to your unfulfillable inventory.
[Manage your unfulfillable inventory](/inventory?viewId=UNFULFILLABLE) as you
normally would.

**Note:** In the event that a returned Grade and Resell unit is found to be
defective, Amazon will refund the applicable processing fee as a courtesy
waiver hence assumes the processing cost on your behalf.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Can non-US sellers participate in FBA Grade and Resell?

Yes, FBA Grade and Resell is open to both US and non-US sellers who are
selling in the US.

#### How much recovery value can I earn through the program?

FBA Grade and Resell allows you to relist eligible, unfulfillable inventory on
Amazon. Since you manage the used listing and control the price, you control
the recovery value. To ensure a net positive transaction after fees are
applied, we recommend that you enroll inventory with an average selling price
above $13.

#### What if my submitted item is graded as Unsellable?

If your item is graded as **Unsellable** , it remains in your unfulfillable
inventory and FBA Grade and Resell fees do not apply. The unsellable item
appears under the parent ASIN with a new FNSKU that begins with **amzn.gr**
and ends with the suffix **PO**. [Manage your unfulfillable
inventory](/inventory?viewId=UNFULFILLABLE) as you normally would.

####  **How long do used items take to sell and how should I manage these
items?**

Used items typically take longer to sell than new items. Use marketing and
pricing levers to manage your listing as you normally would to decrease the
time to sell. To recover value on excess items, consider submitting
fulfillable inventory to [Amazon Outlet](/gp/help/HLYT4TPVCY2MJE3). You can
also liquidate items through [FBA liquidations](/gp/help/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF),
place a removal order, or automate removal actions in your [Automated
fulfillable inventory settings](/recoveryui/removal-setting/automated-lts).

#### I’ve submitted ASINs for exclusion. How long does it take for the updates
to take effect?

Submissions for products to be excluded from Grade and Resell will take effect
immediately unless there is grading in progress, in which case ASIN exclusion
from Grade and Resell can take up to two days.

####  What is stranded inventory?

Stranded inventory refers to the items in a fulfillment center not associated
with an active offer and therefore not available for purchase. Resolve
stranded Grade and Resell inventory by changing the listed price or removing
the listing altogether.

#### How does Grade and Resell differ from Amazon Resale?

Although both programs use the same grading process, the source of the
inventory differs. Items offered through Grade and Resell are sourced from
participating FBA Sellers’ eligible customer returns, while Amazon Resale
listings originate via the FBA reimbursement policy.

#### My item has internal memory. Will the memory be wiped?

We follow its standard operating procedures to carefully handle items with
internal memory but do not guarantee removal of data. Before customers return
items on which they have saved personal information, they should clear the
memory device. This is specified in Amazon’s [customer returns
policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201819200)
for items such as laptops, cameras, or other electronic devices.

#### How can I unenroll from Grade and Resell?

You can unenroll from the program by selecting Automated unfillable settings,
then deselecting "Grade and Resell". Sellers who opt out are able to re-enroll
at any time.
