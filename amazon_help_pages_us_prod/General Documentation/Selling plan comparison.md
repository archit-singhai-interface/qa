For answers to common questions about Professional selling plan fees, go to
[Monthly subscription fee](/gp/help/G67WTAUHB9TQ9M6U).

If you want to stop selling for a period of time (for example, if you can't
fulfill orders for any reason, such as family emergency, inclement weather,
going on a vacation, and so on), you can temporarily suspend your Professional
or Individual selling plan account. For more information, go to [Listing
status](/gp/help/G200135620).

If you decide to close your account rather than upgrading or downgrading your
selling plan, review guidelines on the [Close your seller
account](/gp/help/G200399470) page.
