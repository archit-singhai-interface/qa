The SKU economics report provides aggregated historical data to help you
understand the economics of your products over time at the parent-ASIN, child-
ASIN, MSKU, or FNSKU level for a selected time period and Amazon store. This
includes data for Sales, Fees, Ads, Per-Unit costs, and Net Proceeds. Data in
this report can be up to 24 hours old.

Follow the steps on the [SKU Economics report page](/sereport) to select the
Amazon Store, data aggregation level, date range, and data types you would
like to include in your report.

**Accessing and downloading the report**

The downloadable file for this report is provided in a CSV format. If excel
does not automatically detect this format and asks you what format the file is
when opening, select Comma Separated Values or CSV.

**Note:** Sales data for seller-fulfilled listings are not available at the
FNSKU grain because Sales for those listings are tracked by MSKU. If you have
seller-fulfilled listings and think sales data may be missing try running the
report at the MSKU data aggregation level.
