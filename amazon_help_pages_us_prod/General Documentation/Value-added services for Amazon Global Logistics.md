## Amazon-assigned customs broker

Amazon Global Logistics provides access to third-party customs brokers as part
of our end-to-end service. This means that all of your shipments are
automatically routed to an assigned customs broker. For more information,
visit [Amazon Global Logistics importer setup and customs
compliance](/gp/help/ASFW4BD897LNTNN).

## Palletization

For certain pickup and drop-off options, Amazon can palletize your freight for
a fee. If your cargo requires palletization, select **Palletization** when
booking your shipment. The cost will be calculated based on your shipment
volume.
