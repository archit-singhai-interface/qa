This Textbook Rental Policy supplements your seller agreement and applies to
the offer and sale of rentals and rental extensions for physical books on the
applicable Amazon Site (“**Textbook Rentals** ”) throughout the term of your
seller agreement.  
  
### Eligibility

Approval is required to sell Textbook Rentals on Amazon.

### Additional Required Product Information

Customers may rent textbooks pursuant to the [Textbook Rental Terms &
Conditions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201509080),
which Amazon may update in its discretion. Customers may extend a Textbook
Rental or purchase a rented textbook according to those terms. In addition to
the Required Product Information in your seller agreement, each listing for a
Textbook Rental must include pricing information for a rental extension and
the purchase price for the rented book.

### Sales of Textbook Rentals

The definition of “Your Products” in the Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement includes any Textbook Rental. Sales of Textbook Rentals must be
fulfilled exclusively using the Fulfillment by Amazon service. Amazon may
process the fulfillment and return of all Textbook Rentals, including but not
limited to Textbook Rental return grading, in its discretion.

### Fees and Remittance

You agree to pay the Rental Book Service Fee specified on the [Selling on
Amazon Fee Schedule](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200336920) for
each of Your Transactions that is a Textbook Rental. You also agree that we
may remit the Sales Proceeds received by us for rental extensions and
purchases of rented books, less all applicable taxes, fees and other charges,
on a monthly (or at our option, more frequent) basis. If we determine in our
discretion that we are unable to collect payment from a customer for the
purchase price of a textbook rented by that customer, we will remit to you 75%
of the rental price paid by the customer (the “**Partial Remittance** ”),
provided that you will reimburse us the Partial Remittance if the customer
returns the rented book or if we are subsequently able to collect payment from
the customer.
