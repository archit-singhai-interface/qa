There are two different types of roles that can be assigned to users in Amazon
Brand Registry: protection roles and selling roles. Protection roles include
the Administrator, Rights Owner, and Registered Agent. These roles determine
which tools users can access in Brand Registry. [Selling
roles](/help/hub/reference/GJ84K745AL3R5N3Q?ref=brnav_to_helpcenter), which
include Brand Representative and Reseller, are assigned separately and
determine which seller tools users have access to.

When a user enrolls a brand in Brand Registry, that user is automatically
assigned the roles of Administrator and Rights Owner. The Administrator has
the ability to invite other users to their brand and can assign protection
roles and selling roles to the other users.

**Note:** Only users with the Administrator role can assign roles to others.

## Available protection roles

Protection roles are a group of permissions that can be assigned to a Brand
Registry user to enable brand protection benefits, such as access to the
Report a Violation tool and the ability to add additional trademarks and users
to the brand.

**Note:** Users with protection roles do not necessarily have access to brand
selling benefits such as A+ Content, Stores, and Vine. To learn how to enable
these benefits, go to [Brand Registry selling
roles](/help/hub/reference/GJ84K745AL3R5N3Q).

There are three protection roles that are available for Brand Registry
accounts:

  * **Administrator** : The individual who has full permission to add and change protection roles and selling roles to Brand Registry and selling partner accounts
  * **Rights Owner** : The intellectual property owner, or their designated employee, who has access to brand protection benefits such as the Report a Violation tool
  * **Registered Agent** : A third-party selling partner who is not directly associated with the brand but is authorized by the Administrator to use the Report a Violation tool

**Note:** The Rights Owner and Registered Agent roles are mutually exclusive.
A single account cannot have both of these roles for the same brand.

## Brand protection benefits

The following table demonstrates which brand protection benefits and tools are
accessible for each protection role.

**Administrator** | **Rights Owner** | **Registered Agent**  
---|---|---  
User Permissions | Report a Violation | Report a Violation  
Manage intellectual properties | Manage intellectual properties |   
| Project Zero* |   
| [Transparency](/help/hub/reference/GSB2AVC33KWCAYSA)* |   
*Go to the [Project Zero](help/hub/reference/GLWPXVRVZD7AWJZT) and [Transparency](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GSB2AVC33KWCAYSA?ref=brnav_to_helpcenter) help pages to learn more about their eligibility requirements.

**User Permissions** : Administrators use this tool to assign or remove
protection roles.

**Report a Violation** : Rights Owners and Registered Agents use this tool to
notify Amazon of alleged intellectual property infringements.

**Manage intellectual properties** : Administrators use this tool to manage or
connect new intellectual properties to brands that are already enrolled in
Brand Registry.

## Assign protection roles to your brand's users

**Note:** Only users with the Administrator role can assign roles to others.
There can be more than one Administrator for a brand, and all users with the
role have the ability to add, remove, and update role statuses for their
brand. Use discretion when assigning this role. To ensure ease of access, we
recommend having at least two Administrators for your brand.

Before the Administrator can assign protection roles, each user must create a
Brand Registry account and accept the terms and conditions. Users that already
have a Seller or Vendor Central account with Amazon can create a Brand
Registry account with the same credentials.

Then, the Administrator can invite users to your brand. Note that the
invitation requires the following information: the email address associated
with the user’s Brand Registry account, the name of your brand, and the
designated protection role or roles for the user.

If you are the Administrator, follow these steps in Brand Registry to invite a
user to your brand:  

  1. Click the gear icon at the top of the page, and then select **User Permissions**.
  2. Click **Invite a user to your brand**.
  3. Enter the email address associated with the user's Brand Registry account, as well as their name and their preferred language.
  4. Select the brand for which you want to grant the user a protection role.
  5. Choose the store where the user will sign in.
  6. Select the role or roles that you want to assign to the user.
  7. Click **Send invitation**.

The user will receive an email instructing them to accept the invitation.

You can invite as many Brand Registry account users to your brand as you would
like.

To see a list of pending invitations, along with their details, go to the User
Permissions tool and select **Open invitations**.

## Manage protection roles

If you are the Administrator and you would like to manage protection roles
that have already been assigned, follow these steps in Brand Registry:  

  1. Click the gear icon at the top of the page, and then select User Permissions.
  2. Under **Connected users** on the left side of the tool, find the user account that you want to change, and click **Manage**.
  3. Add or remove protection roles by checking or unchecking the corresponding boxes for each brand associated with the user.

## Manage protection role requests

If a Brand Registry user applies with the same trademark of your currently
enrolled brand, they will be given an opportunity to share their contact
information with the Administrator of the brand. Their request will appear in
the Administrator's User Permissions tool, and the Administrator will be able
to assign permissions, at their discretion, to the user.

If you are the Administrator, follow these steps in Brand Registry to add or
decline protection role requests:  

  1. Click the gear icon at the top of the page and then select **User Permissions**.
  2. On the left side of the tool, click **Access requests**.
  3. Approve or decline each of the requests.

## Request protection roles

**Note:** Before requesting a protection role, ensure that you've created your
Brand Registry account and accepted the terms and conditions.

If you are a Brand Registry user and you would like to be assigned a
protection role for a brand, you have several options:

  * If you know the identity of one of the current Administrators of the brand to which you want to be added, you can reach out to them directly and request an invitation to the brand.
  * If you are unsure of the identity of the current Administrators, you can submit a Brand Registry application with the same trademark number as a currently enrolled brand. In this case, the following information applies:
    * You'll be able to share your contact information with the brand's Administrator. If they approve your role request, you’ll be added to the brand.
    * Eligible users can appeal the enrollment status of the brand. If the appeal is accepted, you'll be added as an Administrator to the brand.
  * If you have at least one brand already enrolled in Brand Registry under your account, you can submit your request via Brand Registry Support. Select **Update brand ownership** as the topic. Your request will be reviewed, and you will receive a response accordingly.
