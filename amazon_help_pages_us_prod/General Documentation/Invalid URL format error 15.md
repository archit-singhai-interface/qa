We were unable to download the image because the image URL is not in a valid
format. An example of a correctly formatted image URL is:
http://www.domain.com/directory/image-file.jpg.

To correct this error, submit the image URL in a standard format, based on
this example: http://www.domain.com/directory/image-file.jpg. **Note** : Use
the applicable domain structure per store, for example, www.domain.com or
www.domain.ca.

**Note:**

  * An image file with suffix .gif or .jpg is not required, but is preferred.
  * You can use http, but not https, ftp, or "file" protocols.
  * Avoid spaces and non-alphanumeric characters such as $, ?, @, &, and so on.
