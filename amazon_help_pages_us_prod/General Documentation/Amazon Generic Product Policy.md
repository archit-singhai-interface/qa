## What is a generic product?

Generic products are unbranded products that do not belong to any identifiable
brand. An unbranded product does not have a distinctive name or logo. For
example, a mobile phone case that does not belong to a brand would not have
any branding, so the product should use the string “generic” for the brand
name field when creating a new listing.

  * Using another brand’s Intellectual Property in your generic product listing, or listing a branded product as generic, are violations of our listing policies. For more information, see our [Brand Name](/help/hub/reference/G2N3GKE5SGSHWYRZ) policy.
  * If you are creating a new generic product that does not have a unique identifier, such as Universal Product Code (UPC) or Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), you must first request a GTIN Exemption in the desired store and product category. To make a request, go to [List products that do not have a Product ID (UPC, EAN, JAN or ISBN)](/help/hub/reference/G200426310). You must request this approval for each product category and store in which you want to create a new generic product without any product identifier.

For more information on creating a new product, go to [Product detail page
rules](/help/hub/reference/G200390640).

## What is the purpose of this policy?

This policy helps customers differentiate amongst similar-looking generic
products. If you create a new product with the brand name "generic" or its
local translation, other sellers won’t be able to make product detail page
changes or add offers.

If you try to change a product detail page or add offers on another seller’s
generic product, you will receive a listing error. You will then be guided to
create a new product by following the process as outlined in [Add
Products](/productsearch). For more information on error messages associated
with the policy and the steps to resolve your issue, go to [Error messages
related to Amazon generic product
policy](/help/hub/reference/G5VG3YWGGXF4Y5WB).
