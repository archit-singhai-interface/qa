Error codes 5664, 5665 or 5668 appear when you try to create an ASIN with a
brand name that hasn’t been approved by Amazon. To resolve your listing issue,
submit an application that provides the required documents as listed in the
chart further down.

Important guidelines to remember before applying for Brand Name Approval:

  * If the brand name is a product type, product description, model number, or anything else besides a brand name, your application will be declined.
  * The brand name is case sensitive, so make sure there are no spelling errors or extra word spacing. For example, 'Amazon Essentials' has correct word spacing, but 'AmazonEssentials' (No space in between) has incorrect word spacing.
  * Brand name approval applies across all countries, so you don’t have to submit an application for every country.
  * After a brand name is approved by Amazon, it may take up to 24 hours for you to be able to create your listings with the new brand name. If you continue to encounter the 5665 error for the approved brand after 24 hours, contact us.

To help us review your request as quickly as possible, make sure that your
documents meet all of the requirements listed in the selling application.

Error code | Error cause | Application requirements  
---|---|---  
5664 | You may be listing a generic product but not using "generic" as the brand name, which is a violation of the [Amazon Brand Name policy](/gp/help/G2N3GKE5SGSHWYRZ). |  If you receive an error with this code, recreate the error by adding the product and following the instructions on [Add Products](/product-search?ref=xx_catadd_dnav_home). Click the link in the error message and complete the application with the required information mentioned below:

  * The brand name of the product that you used when the listing was attempted The brand name for which you’re requesting approval must be spelled exactly as you want it to appear on the detail page, and have the exact same characters. Any variance may result in the error occurring again. 
  * Include an image of your brand’s logo without other products in the picture. Label the image file as your brand name. (Optional)
  * Include at least two images of your brand product and packaging.
  * Images must follow the guidelines for product images and meet these technical requirements:
    * Images must be real world and not computer-generated. In a real-world image, the product and packaging is held in your hand or placed on a table or other surface while the picture is taken. Digitally altered images will result in your application being declined.
    * The product pictures must not be blurry or truncated (cut off). The text in the images, such as the brand name, must be legible.
    * The images must be clearly visible and the brand name must be permanently affixed to the product or packaging. The brand name must be stamped, stitched, printed, or glued on the product, packaging, or both so that it can’t be easily removed. If the product is apparel or jewelry, branded hang tags are acceptable.
    * The branding on your product or packaging must match exactly, although differences in capitalization are allowed.
    * If requesting a GTIN exemption, images must include all sides of your product and packaging, and must not have a GS1 barcode. If GS1 barcode is present, you may use it as the product id. For more information, go to [List products that do not have a Product ID (UPC, EAN, JAN or ISBN)](/gp/help/G200426310).

If you use inventory file templates contact [Selling partner
support](/help/center?redirectSource=HelpHub), choose issue type **Adding a
product** , Select error 5664 or 5665, fill and complete the form. In the form
provide the batch ID of the inventory file processing report.  
5665 | Brand name approval is required. The brand name that was entered hasn't been approved by Amazon.  
5668 | The brand name is missing for the ASIN. Per Amazon policy, ASINs belonging to an identifiable brand must have a brand name. If the product is unbranded, you can create a generic ASIN. For more information, go to [Amazon Brand Name policy](/gp/help/G2N3GKE5SGSHWYRZ). |  To resolve this error, download your uploaded listing template and check the brand value on the **Feed Processing Summary** tab in the template. Provide a brand name as the brand value and resubmit the file. The brand name must match the name of the brand that produced the product and must be visibly branded on the product. If you are listing an unbranded product enter "generic" as the value. By resubmitting the file with the brand value filled correctly, you will resolve the error.  
  
## Sample image that meets the application requirements

Product images must be real, unaltered photos, not computer-generated. Images
should be clear and legible, with the brand name permanently affixed to the
product or packaging. For apparel/jewelry, branded hang tags are acceptable.

Below is an example of a real-world image where the brand name AmazonBasics is
permanently affixed to the product.

## Brand value for generic products

Generic products are unbranded products that don’t belong to any identifiable
brand. An unbranded product doesn’t have a distinctive name or logo.

For more information, go to [Amazon Generic Product
policy](/gp/help/G84H3T69ZX762NWT).

## Brand value for bundles

For information on bundles with more than one branded product, go to [Product
Bundling policy](/gp/help/G200442350).

## Brand value for compatible products

The ASIN must use the brand value that matches the brand on the product
itself. For example, if a product is an unbranded USB charging cable that is
compatible with Amazon Basics speakers, then the brand value must be "generic"
because the charging cable is unbranded.

Product image or title  | Brand value displayed on product detail page | Explanation  
---|---|---  
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/Speakers_snip_for_error_page.png) | Amazon Basics | This brand value on the detail page for these computer speakers is **correct**. The brand value is "Amazon Basics" because the product is from Amazon Basics and has the brand name imprinted on it.   
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/Cable_snip_for_error_page.png) | Generic | The product title on the detail page for these USB charging cables notes that they're compatible with Amazon Basics speakers. The brand value "generic" is **correct** , because the product title indicates compatibility without stating that these cables are an Amazon Basics branded product. The brand value is "generic" because the product is not from any brand, and no brand name is permanently affixed to the product.   
Six-foot USB charging cable, compatible with Amazon Basics speakers | Amazon Basics |  This brand value is **incorrect**. The brand value is "Amazon Basics," but the product is not part of the Amazon Basics brand. Because the product isn't part of any brand and doesn't have a brand's name on it, the correct brand value is "generic."  
Wireless Speaker, Inc. six-foot USB charging cable, compatible with Amazon Basics speakers | Wireless Speaker, Inc. | This brand value is **correct**. The product title on the product detail page indicates compatibility without implying that this is an Amazon Basics branded product. The brand value is "Wireless Speaker, Inc." because the product is from that company and is branded with the company's name.  
  
## Brand value for Amazon Merch on Demand products

Merch on Demand businesses print designs on products such as shirts and coffee
mugs, after a customer places an order for the product.

Merch on Demand products must use the brand value "generic" if the product or
packaging is not branded, unless you have a registered trademark. In that
case, you can enroll in [Brand Registry](https://brandservices.amazon.com/),
which will allow you to list ASINs with your brand’s name as the brand value.
If the product or packaging from the Merch on Demand business is branded, then
the ASINs must use that business’s name as the brand value.

## Brand value for Amazon Renewed ASINs

Amazon Renewed ASINs must use the brand value of the original product. For
example, if you're listing a Renewed Amazon Basics wireless mouse, then the
brand value is still "Amazon Basics." For more information, go to [Amazon
Renewed listing guide](/gp/help/G202190060).
