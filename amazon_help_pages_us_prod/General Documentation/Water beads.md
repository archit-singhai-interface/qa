If you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws,
regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product
listings.

## Water beads covered by this policy

Water beads are super-absorbent polymer spheres of different sizes and colors
that expand to many times their original size when exposed to moisture. They
are known by many names, including sensory beads, jelly beads, water orbs,
hydro orbs, polymer beads, gel beads, water growing gel balls, water gel pearl
beads, and water growing balls. Water beads provide water to plants and
animals, and they’re also marketed as toys, art material products, and
learning aids for children.

## Our policy for water beads

Customers have to be confident that they’ll find a selection of safe,
reliable, and compliant products on Amazon. We don’t allow the listing or sale
of non-compliant or prohibited products. In the interest of safety, product
listings for water beads will be removed if they:

  * Refer to children, or use terms such as "child," "kids," “youth,” “boys,” or “girls”
  * Include images of children with the product
  * Describe their use as a toy, educational material, art material, or use terms such as "sensory play,” “arts,” or “crafts”

If you believe that your product has been incorrectly classified as
prohibited, submit the following information to [highrisk-
childsafety@amazon.com](mailto:highrisk-childsafety@amazon.com):

  * A list of the ASINs that you believe have been misclassified
  * An explanation of why you believe that the ASINs have been misclassified
  * Evidence to demonstrate that the ASINs have been misclassified
