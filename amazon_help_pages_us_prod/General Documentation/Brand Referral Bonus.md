#### What is the Brand Referral Bonus program?

The Brand Referral Bonus program gives brands an opportunity to earn a bonus
from non-Amazon marketing efforts and improve their advertising efficiency.
For more information about the program, go to [Brand Referral Bonus](/brand-
referral-bonus).

#### Why should I participate?

The Brand Referral Bonus program credits Brands an average of 10% of sales
from traffic you have driven to Amazon. The program helps you advertise
efficiently by receiving the same bonus for customer purchases of additional
products from the Brand up to 14 days after clicking on the ad. The program
also helps you accelerate growth by improving the efficiency of your non-
Amazon marketing efforts that drive referral traffic to Amazon.

#### How is my bonus calculated?

On average, Brands can earn a 10% bonus from their qualifying sales. To
estimate your bonus, multiply your qualifying sales by the minimum bonus rate
in the corresponding product category. Your actual bonus rate may vary based
on inputs such as additional shipping and gift wrapping charges, which may
vary between selling partners. The actual bonus applied to your sales can be
viewed in your weekly bonus report. See estimated category bonus rate below.

*Your actual bonus rate can vary based on inputs such as additional shipping and gift wrapping charges, which may vary between selling partners. This estimated bonus rate table is provided to simplify your ability to estimate the bonus you will receive. The actual bonus applied to your sales can be viewed in your weekly bonus report.

#### When and how do I receive the bonus?

There is a wait time (two months) before the bonus is credited to your account
to accommodate order cancellation and customer returns. For example, if a
qualified sale occurred in July, the bonus will be credited to your account in
September. The bonus will be used to deduct the referral fees in transactions
for September and going forward, until the bonus gets exhausted.

There are two ways to track the bonus payments in transaction details:
Scenario A: When the bonus partially or fully covers the referral fee and
there is a tax on the fee, bonus payments will show up in the discount on
referral fee line. Scenario B: If bonus payments cover the entire referral fee
and there is no tax on the fee, the bonus will be applied in the background
and the Referral Fee section will not be shown in the transaction.

#### What purchases qualify for the Brand Referral Bonus program?

The bonus applies to brand-owned products with an Amazon Attribution tag that
originates from a non-Amazon marketing effort. This includes promoted products
and additional products purchased from the same brand up to 14 days after
clicking on the ad.

#### Who is eligible to join the Brand Referral Bonus program?

All selling partners with a [Brand Representative](/gp/help/GJ84K745AL3R5N3Q)
role assigned to a registered brand in Brand Registry selling in Amazon’s US
store are eligible to enroll. If you sell on Amazon but have not registered
your brand yet, go to [Brand Benefit Eligibility](/brands/brand-relationships)
to enroll your brand in Amazon Brand Registry through the Brand Self Service
Identification program.

#### How do I get started?

  

  1. Register for the Brand Referral Bonus program.
  2. Enroll in Amazon Attribution if you are not already enrolled.
  3. Create tags for your promoted products using Amazon Attribution. All traffic must have an Amazon Attribution tag in order to qualify for the bonus.
  4. Launch your advertising effort.

#### How do I learn more about adding tags to my advertising efforts on
different channels?

To learn more on how to implement tags for different channels, refer to
[Amazon Attribution campaign
creation](https://advertising.amazon.com/help?#GJXTJCLK4WTWTQWU).

#### I am a Reseller. Can I join?

The Brand Referral Bonus is only available for Brand Representatives. If you
are a Reseller, you can join the [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-
program.amazon.com/) program to earn commissions from sales you generate.

#### How do I find my Brand Referral Bonus balance?

There are two ways to find your Brand Referral Bonus. First, you can see your
earned bonus under the transaction details of your account. Second, you can
download the bonus report to see a performance summary.

**Note:** If you have no qualified sales over the last 90 days, a report will
not be generated.

#### Where do I find the Brand Referral Bonus report?

The system generates a report every Friday to summarize the estimated bonus
amount earned up to the preceding Friday. For example, if you download the
report on July 23, 2021, you can see the estimated bonus amount earned up to
July 16, 2021. If you have no qualified sales over the last 90 days, a report
will not be generated. If you have made qualified sales, you can download the
report from your Brand Referral Bonus page within Seller Central.

#### How do I opt out of Brand Referral Bonus?

You can contact Selling Partner Support and let them know you would like to
opt out of the program.

#### I am an existing Amazon Attribution user. Do I get a bonus from sales
from previously created Amazon Attribution tags?

Yes. We will calculate your bonus from all qualifying sales attributed by
Amazon Attribution starting the day you enroll for Brand Referral Bonus.

#### How do secondary users get access to enroll for Brand Referral Bonus or
access reporting?

To enroll and access reports, secondary users need a primary user to grant
access.

To grant access:

  

  1. Go to **Settings** > **User Permissions** > **Manage Permissions**.
  2. In **Performance** section go to **Brand Referral Bonus**.
  3. Click **View** to download reports, or click **View & Edit **to enroll in Brand Referral Bonus.

#### Are there any tax consequences for my business triggered by opting into
the Brand Referral Bonus program?

Depending on the local law, opting for the program may subject you to tax and
invoicing obligations in your local country, that is the country where you or
your business is located. For example, if you are a US person for tax
purposes, the Brand Referral Bonus earned from the program will be reported to
both you and the IRS on an annual basis on IRS Form 1099-NEC if reporting
thresholds are exceeded. You should consult your tax advisor if you have any
questions about your tax obligations as a result of the program.

#### Do I have to provide tax information in order to get the bonus?

Yes, providing tax information is required to receive the Brand Referral
Bonus. We may request tax information from you time to time. If we request tax
information from you and you do not provide it, we can hold your Brand
Referral Bonuses until you do.

#### If I had provided tax information earlier through Seller Central, should
the tax information given through the Tax Interview form now reflect the
latest information, or should it match the information that was provided
earlier?

The tax information collected through the Brand Referral Bonus page is
specific to the program, and must be provided to receive the Brand Referral
Bonus. You can update other tax information in Seller Central if your current
tax circumstances have changed.

#### How can I provide the required tax information?

There are two ways to provide the tax information:

  * through a banner on top of the Brand Referral Bonus page which contains a link to the Tax Interview form, which will be visible if you have not yet completed the tax interview
  * through the “When and how do I receive the bonus?” section in the Brand Referral Bonus page which also contains the link to the Tax Interview form. This link is always available, and can be used to update your tax information to reflect the latest status.

#### How should I select the responses in the tax information interview form?

Answers to the questions on the tax information form will depend on your exact
tax circumstance. The tool tips on each question can provide some helpful
information to determine how to answer each question. If you are unsure of any
financial or tax obligations, we suggest you contact your accounting or tax
professional or the taxing jurisdiction.

#### If I am a non-US person without a US Tax Information Number (TIN), how
can I learn what to enter as the foreign TIN?

A Foreign Tax Identification Number (TIN) corresponds to the tax
identification number issued by your country of tax residency for the purposes
of identification and tracking payments for federal taxes. Common examples are
**SIN** for Canada, **PAN** for India, **Hojin Number** (Hojin Bango) for
Japan, **CURP** for Mexico, **NRIC/FIN** for Singapore, **DNI/TIN** for Spain.
Provide the tax identification number issued by your local tax authority for
income tax purposes. For more information about standards and structure of Tax
Identification Numbers issued globally, go to [OECD Tax Identification Number­
portal](https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-
assistance/tax-identification-numbers). You can find country or jurisdiction
specific TIN structures, such as China, in this portal by clicking on the name
of the country or jurisdiction.

#### How do I know if I am a US person for tax purposes?

For U.S. federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:

  * An individual who is a U.S. citizen
  * An individual who is a U.S. resident alien as you meet the [Green Card Test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/alien-residency-green-card-test).
  * Additionally, you will be considered a United States resident for tax purposes if you meet the [Substantial Presence Test ](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test) for the calendar year. More information about these distinctions is available on the [U.S. IRS Website ](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/classification-of-taxpayers-for-us-tax-purposes).
  * A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States
  * An estate (other than a foreign estate)
  * A U.S. domestic trust

#### Am I eligible as a non-US person selling in the United States?

If you are a non-US person (for U.S. federal tax purposes) participating in
the Brand Referral Bonus program, you are eligible to receive the bonus only
if you perform all services under the Agreement outside the United States, as
designated through the tax information interview. If you indicate in the tax
information interview that all or part of your services are or will be
performed inside the United States, this means that you are or will be
physically located in the United States when performing your services. If you
are a non-US person and performing the services within the United States, you
are not eligible to receive the bonus. If you believe the tax information is
incorrect, you can update the tax information in the tax interview form.

#### If I have completed the tax interview and am subsequently considered
ineligible for the Brand Referral Bonus program, how can I understand why I am
ineligible based on provided tax information?

While the exact reason for ineligibility depends on your specific tax
circumstance, one instance where this can be the case is if you are a non-US
person and performing the services within the United States, as designated
through the tax information interview. This can happen if you indicate in the
tax information interview that all or part of your services are or will be
performed inside the United States, as this means that you are or will be
physically located in the United States when performing your services. If you
are unsure of which circumstance might apply in your specific case, we suggest
consulting your tax advisor directly. If you believe the tax information is
incorrect, you can update the tax information in the tax interview form. For
more tax related information, refer to the [Tax
policies](/gp/help/G200405820).

#### How can I get help with completing the tax information in the tax
interview or to learn about other tax consequences resulting from
participating in the Brand Referral Bonus program?

You should consult your tax advisor if you have any questions about your tax
obligations as a result of the program. Our [Solutions Provider
Network](https://services.amazon.com/solution-providers/#/search/US/tax) has
several external tax providers you can consider if you do not already have a
tax professional.
