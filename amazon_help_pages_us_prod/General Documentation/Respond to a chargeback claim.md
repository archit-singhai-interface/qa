When a buyer contacts their credit card company to request a chargeback, the
credit card company will contact Amazon to request details about the
transaction. In turn, Amazon will contact you via email to request transaction
information.

You can respond to a chargeback claim in one of two ways:

  * Issue an immediate refund. For more information, see [Refund Options](/gp/help/201725630).
  * Represent your case to the credit card company via Amazon. You can represent your case either on the **Chargeback Claims** page listed in the **Performance** menu in Seller Central, or by replying to the chargeback email you received from Amazon.

**Note:**

  * You can refund or represent an **Action Required** chargeback in Seller Central even if you have not received the chargeback email from Amazon.
  * You must respond to any chargeback claim within seven calendar days of the email date. If you do not respond, we might debit your account for the transaction. You should also reply to any additional requests for information within the time frame stated in the request.

To represent your case in Seller Central, do the following:

  1. From the **Performance** menu, select **Chargeback Claims**. 

  2. Click **Represent your case**.

**Note:**

     * **Represent your case** option is listed under both **All** and **Action Required** tab.
     * You also can represent your case by replying to the chargeback email with the requested information.

  3. Read the **Review the Chargeback and Order Details** section.

  4. Complete the **Represent your case** section.
     * Buyers do not see your comments; they are for Amazon investigators only.
     * Provide the shipping date, the shipping method used, and any tracking information. If the buyer claims they received an item that is materially different from what they saw on the website, we might request information about the item.
     * We encourage you to include any correspondence you might have had with the buyer in your response to our notification.
     * Include as much information as possible in your initial response. If you don't provide a sufficient response, don't adhere to the [Business Solutions Agreement](/gp/help/1791), or the card issuer decides in favor of the cardholder, we will debit your account.

  5. Click **Continue** to submit your response.

An Amazon investigator reviews the information provided, creates supporting
documentation ("representment"), and submits it to the issuing bank on your
behalf. We will contact you if further information is required.

The final outcome can take up to 90 days (or longer in rare cases) from the
date the charge was represented to the issuing bank. We will inform you of the
outcome, via email, only if you are financially responsible for the
chargeback. The email will outline the reasons why.

If you feel that you were debited for a chargeback in error, reply to the
email. We will review your dispute. However, in the majority of cases, the
issuing bank's decision is final and there is no recourse to appeal that
decision.
