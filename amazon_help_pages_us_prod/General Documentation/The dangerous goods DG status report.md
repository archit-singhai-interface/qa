Your dangerous goods status report gives you current information on the status
of your FBA listings that are classified as dangerous goods (DG), including
listings currently under DG review. Dangerous goods are also known as
hazardous materials or hazmat. [See examples of
products](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=200525640&)
that may be regulated as dangerous goods. The information in this report is
refreshed once every day. Products that are not DG are not included in this
report.

If your product is under DG review, it can take up to four business days for
the product compliance team to review the product. If the product is FBA-
eligible, you will be able to create or convert a listing when the ASIN is
classified as a DG. You may be required to provide additional classification
information, such as an Amazon exemption sheet or a manufacturer Safety Data
Sheet for classification to be completed.

To see if an ASIN has completed the DG review process, select the "Look up an
ASIN" option on the [FBA Dangerous Goods Review
Process](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G201749580?) help page, or
search for "dangerous goods" in Seller Central.
