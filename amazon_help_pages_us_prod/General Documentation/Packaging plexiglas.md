Proper preparation of products packaged in plexiglas or made of plexiglas is
required to prevent damage throughout the fulfillment process.

**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product prep requirements, safety
requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of inventory
at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory, blocking of
future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for preparation for
noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

All items shipped to an Amazon fulfillment center that are made of or packaged
in plexiglas require a label at least 2"x3" that states that the product is
plexiglas.

These labels help distinguish plexiglas products from products that are made
of glass, which require special packaging and handling.
