increasing sales through advertising or reducing costs. Adjust the time frame,
target metrics, and any relevant constraints, and our planner will provide
tailored recommendations to help you achieve your objectives.

Key steps include adjusting budgets, refining targeting, testing creatives, leveraging different formats and identifying top deals. These strategies increase customers, improve brand visibility and enhance overall sales.

**How are goals recommended?**

Goals are recommended based on the performance of similar cohorts, these
cohorts are groups of sellers who share similar characteristics, such as
business size, product categories, or sales volume. By analyzing the
performance of these cohorts, we can recommend goals that are both challenging
and realistic, helping you to improve in areas where similar businesses have
found success.

**Feedback and collaboration**

We value your input! Leave feedback can be found in the top left portion of
your screen next to “Business Planner” or use the "Thumbs Up/Down" feature to
