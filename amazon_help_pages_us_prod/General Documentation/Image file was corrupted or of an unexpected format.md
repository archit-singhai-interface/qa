An image will fail to upload if the file is incomplete, corrupted, in the
wrong format, or too large.

Common reasons for receiving this error may be that the file type extension
was incorrectly attached or it was an unflattened TIFF or PSD file that was
saved as a JPG. We accept JPEG (.jpg or .jpeg), TIFF (.tif), PNG (.png) or
non-animated GIF (.gif) files with either RGB or CMYK color models. JPEG is
recommended.

You may also get this error if there are color tonal variations in the image
(which may occur when CMYK images are used on the website). RGB images are
preferred. Images with more than 10,000 pixels in either height or width may
also cause this error.

If you get this error, verify the image file format:

  * If you cannot view the file, it may be corrupt. You can try using an image editing program to change the file extension to a known file type, as it may have been assigned the wrong extension. If the file appears to have an extension other than the current named extension, flatten and re-save it as a JPEG using an image editing program.
  * If you can view the file, it may be incomplete. In this case, try using an image editing program to re-save the file as a JPEG.

Before you upload a corrected file, verify that it can be viewed on your
computer using a preview or image-editing program.
