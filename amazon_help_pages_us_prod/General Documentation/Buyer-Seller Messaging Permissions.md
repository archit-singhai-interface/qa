If you have more than one person within your company handling buyer
communications, you can approve or block their email addresses to communicate
with the buyers using the **Messaging Permissions** tool on the [Buyer-Seller
Messages](/messaging/inbox) page.  
  
**Note:** Email messages to the buyers not coming from the account's
registered email address on Buyer-Seller Messaging or from an authorized email
address will be rejected. These email messages will need to be resent after
authorizing the email address.

You can approve or block senders from the [Messaging
Permissions](/gp/communication-manager/address-authorization.html) page.

The **Messaging Permissions** page displays the following:

  * Email addresses of those within your company to whom you have granted access to send emails to the buyers through Buyer-Seller Messaging.
  * Email addresses of those whom have not yet been approved or have been blocked from sending messages to buyers.

Email addresses can be personal email aliases as well as group email aliases
(for example, the customer service department of your company).

To add an additional authorized email address or change the status of a
current email address, follow these steps:  

  1. Visit the [Messaging Permissions](/gp/communication-manager/address-authorization.html) page.
  2. Click **+Add an email address** at the bottom of the Email column.
  3. Input the email address and select the appropriate status from the Approved, Blocked, or Delete options.
  4. Click **Save**.

To change the status of a previously entered email address, follow these
steps:  

  1. Visit the [Messaging Permissions](/gp/communication-manager/address-authorization.html) page.
  2. Click **Edit**.  

    1. To change an address from blocked to approved, click the radio button in the **Approved column**.
    2. To change an address from approved to blocked, click the radio button in the **Blocked column**.
  3. Click **Save**.

**Note:** You can approve an internal sender that was previously blocked or
block an internal sender that was previously approved. However, you can't
delete the email address of an internal sender if it has already been approved
or blocked.
