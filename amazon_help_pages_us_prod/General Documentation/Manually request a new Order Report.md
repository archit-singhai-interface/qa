A manually requested Order Report provides all orders received for the number
of days you select and includes orders you have canceled and orders you have
confirmed as shipped.

  1. From the **Orders** menu, select [Order Reports](/order-reports-and-feeds/reports/newOrders).

  2. Select **New Orders**.

  3. In the **Request Report** section, select the number of days to include in the report.

**Note:** The days are determined working backward in 24-hour increments
beginning the minute you request the report. For example, if it is 2:32 p.m.
on Monday and you select **1** from the drop-down menu, you will receive a
report for orders received at 2:32 p.m. Monday through 2:32 p.m. Sunday.

  4. Click **Request**.

Your report will appear in the **Download Report** section of the Order
Reports page. It can take up to 45 minutes to generate your report.
