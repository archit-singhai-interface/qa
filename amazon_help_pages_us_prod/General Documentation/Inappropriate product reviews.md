You can ask for reviews from customers who purchased your products off Amazon.
However, note that all the [customer reviews
policies](/gp/help/YRKB5RU3FS5TURN) apply to these reviews as well.  
  
We encourage you to monitor reviews regularly and reach out to customers to
resolve product or service issues. However, you cannot ask customers to change
or remove their review, even after an issue is resolved. For answers to common
questions about customer product reviews, see [Answers to questions about
product reviews](/gp/help/201972160).

The following are examples of prohibited activities. This is not an all-
inclusive list.

  * A seller posts a review of their own product or their competitor's product either in their own name or as an unbiased buyer.
  * A seller offers a third party a financial reward, discount, or other compensation in exchange for a review on their product or their competitor’s product. This includes services that sell customer reviews and websites or social media groups with implicit or explicit agreements or expectations that an incentive is contingent on customers leaving a review.
  * A seller offers to provide a refund or reimbursement after the buyer writes a review (including reimbursement via a non-Amazon payment method).
  * A seller uses a third-party service that offers free or discounted products tied to a review (for example, a review club that requires customers to register their Amazon public profile so that sellers may monitor their reviews).
  * A family member or employee of the seller posts a review of the seller's product or a competitor's product.
  * A seller offers a refund or other compensation to a reviewer in exchange for changing or removing their review.
  * A seller only asks for reviews from buyers who had a positive experience and attempts to divert buyers who had a negative experience to a different feedback mechanism. This includes cases where the customer proactively reaches out to the seller to express satisfaction with their products. 
  * A seller creates a variation relationship between products that are not actually related to each other in order to boost a product’s star rating.
  * A seller inserts a request for a positive Amazon review or an incentive in exchange for a review into product packaging.
  * A seller manipulates the 'Helpful', 'Not Helpful', or 'Report Abuse' features on any review on his or his competitor’s products.

**Note:** References to 'seller' here includes all the seller’s employees and
third-party partners.
