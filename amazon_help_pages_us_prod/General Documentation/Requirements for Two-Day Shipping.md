Two-Day Shipping is a fast Premium Shipping option only available to sellers
that meet high delivery performance standards.

Customers expect their packages to be delivered quickly, so you must maintain
the requirements for the following metrics. If you don't meet these
requirements, Two-Day Shipping might be disabled on your offers.

  * **You must sell on Amazon for at least 90 days.**
  * **Order count:** Ten or more orders in the past 30 days across all shipping options.
  * **Valid tracking rate:** Greater than or equal to 94%. For the United States, this includes tracking IDs from UPS, USPS, Fedex, or OnTrac. To learn more, see [Valid Tracking Rate](/gp/help/201817070).
  * **On-time delivery rate:** Greater than or equal to 92%. For more information, see [On-Time Delivery Score](/gp/help/200633610).

##  Two-Day on-time delivery

You are required to deliver on or before the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) for
at least 92% of Two-Day Shipping orders on a trailing 30-day basis.

Two-Day Shipping will show an Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) that is two or
three business days after the order date. Orders that you receive Monday-
Friday before 2:00 p.m. ET/11:00 a.m. PT, will show an EDD that is two
business days after the order date. Orders that you receive after 2:00 p.m.
ET/11:00 a.m. PT on a business day, or on a weekend or holiday, will show an
EDD that is three business days after the order date.

Your carrier should deliver the package to the buyer on or before the EDD.

**Note:** If the delivery carrier attempts but fails to deliver a package, it
counts as being delivered for the purposes of this requirement.

##  Tracking

You are required to use a trackable shipping method and provide valid tracking
IDs. Your performance metrics must show a minimum of a 94% tracking rate on
orders placed with Two-Day Shipping.

Amazon assesses eligibility to offer Premium Shipping options on a trailing
30-day basis. Tracking numbers will be considered valid only if they have at
least one carrier scan recorded.

##  Carrier requirements

You are required to use UPS, USPS, FedEx, or OnTrac to deliver orders placed
with Two-Day Shipping.
