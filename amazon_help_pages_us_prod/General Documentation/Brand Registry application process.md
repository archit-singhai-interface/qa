## Brand Registry application process  
  
The Brand Registry application helps us identify and enroll your brand so that
we can protect your intellectual property in our store.

To learn more about the country-specific requirements needed to complete the
application, go to [Enrollment guidelines for accepted trademark
offices](/help/hub/reference/GHUDSVJLN4U9WY8Z).

## Product image requirements

We ask that you submit at least one image of your product or product packaging
as part of the application. The submitted pictures will be used solely for the
purpose of reviewing your application, and customers will not have access to
them.

You can use your phone’s camera to capture clear pictures of your product and
its packaging. Note that Amazon does not consider a mockup or digitally
altered image of the product or product packaging (for example, the brand name
or logo edited onto the product or packaging) as valid proof of intellectual
property ownership. Therefore, any product image provided during Brand
Registry enrollment must be an unaltered, genuine image of the product or its
packaging.

If an application is submitted with a mockup or digitally altered image, the
brand may be subject to additional scrutiny during enrollment, and in some
cases, removal from the program.

Before uploading your image, ensure that it isn't blurry and that it clearly
displays your brand’s name. The brand name on the product must be easily
readable and match the exact trademark name on your application.

Ensure also that the brand name is **permanently affixed** to the product.
Permanently affixed brand names are typically added during production and can
be printed, sewn, laser-etched, or engraved onto items. Stickers, labels, hung
tags, or stamps are not considered permanently affixed since they can be
easily added or removed after production.

Certain products such as furniture, jewelry, soft toys, wigs, and handmade
items, might not have permanently affixed brand names. In these cases, the
product’s packaging must have a brand name that is permanently affixed. Other
products, like phone cases or clothing, can have branding included as part of
the products themselves.

Do not upload images of your brand's logo, trademark certificate, or anything
else that does not showcase your product or its packaging in this section, as
doing so may result in rejection of your application.

## Manage applications

Every application that you start and submit will appear on the **Brand
applications** page. This page provides a log of your applications so that you
can easily find, edit, and review them.

To access this page, sign into Brand Registry, click **Manage** in the top
toolbar, and select [Brand
applications](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/brand/enrollment/manage/applications).

If you’ve created more than one application, you can refine the results by
entering the trademark number or brand name in the search bar. You can also
expand the **Status** and **Trademark office** drop-down menus to apply
additional filters.

If you started an application and want to continue to edit it, find the row
associated with the application and click **Resume** in the **Actions**
column.

**Note:** You can only edit applications that are pending submission.
Applications expire if they are not submitted within three days. If your
application has expired, you can either start a new application or copy the
expired application. To copy the expired application, go to the **Brand
applications** page and find the expired application. Then, click **Copy** in
the **Actions** column and proceed with the application process.

To view more detailed information about an application, click the associated
case ID.

## Review process

It takes an average of 10 business days to review Brand Registry applications.
In some cases, we may need additional information to verify your identity,
which can extend the application review period.

You can always check the status of your application on the **Brand
applications** page. To learn more about each status, review the table below.

Status | Description  
---|---  
Approved | Your application was accepted, and your brand is enrolled in Brand Registry.  
Rejected | Your application was declined, and your brand isn’t enrolled in Brand Registry.  
Pending submission | Your application isn’t complete and hasn’t been submitted.  
Expired | Your application was not completed within three days and therefore expired.  
Ineligible | Your application was considered ineligible. Click the status next to your application’s case ID to learn more.  
Pending review | Your application is under review.  
Withdrawn | Your application has been withdrawn from the enrollment process.   
Removed from Brand Registry | Your brand has been removed from Brand Registry.  
  
After you submit an application, we will verify that you are the rights owner
of the trademark. As part of this process, we might reach out to a contact
that meets our verification requirements. This person will receive a
verification code, and you must send the code back to us to complete the
enrollment process.

To submit a verification code, click the application’s case ID on the **Brand
applications** page, and reply to the case within 10 days with the
verification code and the case ID for the application.

You can also go to your [Case log](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/cu/case-
lobby) in Brand Registry to reply to the case.

## Copy and correct rejected applications

It’s not possible to edit an application that’s been rejected. However, once
you’ve identified the trademark details that need to be updated and are ready
to reapply, you can copy information from the original application into a new
application.

To copy information into a new application, go to the **Brand applications**
page, locate the original application in the table, and click **Copy**. A new
application will appear with the trademark details from your original
application. Correct the necessary details and submit the new application.
