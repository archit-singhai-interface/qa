If you list an offer on a product that falls under the Energy Labeling Rule,
it’s your responsibility to ensure the proper label, icon, or water use
information is displayed on the detail page. The federal [Energy Labeling
Rule](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/part-305) requires that these
products display:

  * Yellow EnergyGuide labels on detail pages for certain appliances 
  * White Lighting Facts labels on detail pages for certain lighting products
  * An energy icon (an encircled capital letter "E") on detail pages for certain lighting products
  * Water use information on detail pages for certain plumbing products

Contact the product manufacturer or private labeler to obtain the proper
label, icon, or water use information to comply with the Energy Labeling Rule.

Sellers and vendors are required to display EnergyGuide labels on detail pages
for the following products:

  * Televisions
  * Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezers, Freezers

Sellers and vendors are required to display Lighting Facts labels on detail
pages for most general service “lamps” with medium screw bases, including most
incandescent, compact fluorescent, and light-emitting diode light bulbs, as
well as specialty consumer lamps.

## Upload images to the Energy Labeling Rule Widget

To upload and display images to the Energy Labeling Rule widget (located below
product images on the detail page), please follow these instructions:

**Instructions for sellers in Seller Central**

  

  1. Contact the product manufacturer to get a URL for the applicable EnergyGuide or Lighting Facts label image.
  2. Download the applicable inventory file template. (Templates that contain Energy Labeling Rule fields include: [ **Tools & Home Improvement** ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/seller-templates/ff/na/us/Flat.File.HomeImprovement.xls), [ **Home & Garden** ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/seller-templates/ff/na/us/Flat.File.Home.xlsm), [ **Lighting** ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/seller-templates/ff/na/us/Flat.File.Lighting.xls), and [ **Consumer Electronics** ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/seller-templates/ff/na/us/Flat.File.ConsumerElectronics.xlsm).)
  3. Depending on the product, find the **Energy Guide Label (energy_efficiency_image_url)** or **Lighting Facts Label (lighting_facts_image_url)** field and enter the URL of the label image from the product manufacturer's website.
  4. Open [ **Add Products via Upload** ](/hz/inventory/addproducts/download?ref_=au_download_tnav_upload) on Seller Central and upload your inventory file.

**Instructions for vendors in Vendor Central:**

  

  1. Identify (or obtain from the product manufacturer) the appropriate label image (For example: EnergyGuide Label, Lighting Facts Label) for each ASIN.
  2. Name each image file. The naming convention for image files must be in the following format: “ASIN.Variant.jpg”. For EnergyGuide Labels, the variant must be EGUS (for example, B000123456.EGUS.jpg). For Lighting Facts Labels, the variant must be ELFL (for example, B000123456.ELFL.jpg). Please note that images must be at least 500 pixels on their largest side. See [Choose the right image](https://vendorcentral.amazon.com/st/vendor/members/help?topicId=201309950) for more information about image quality.
  3. Use [Upload Product Images](https://vendorcentral.amazon.com/gp/vendor/members/image-upload/product-image-upload). Please note that you may upload multiples images at a time by zipping the images and uploading the zipped file.

**Note:**

  * If you list an offer on an existing ASIN, it's your responsibility to ensure the applicable label is displayed on the product detail page.
  * If another seller or vendor has previously uploaded the required label images to the widget, the label will be displayed on the detail page below the product images.
  * Even if the label has previously been loaded as a product image on an existing ASIN, load your label image into the widget using the instructions above.

## Energy icon

Sellers and vendors are required to display an energy icon (an encircled
capital letter "E" ) on detail pages as a product name for the following
products:

  * General Service Fluorescent Lamps
  * Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts
  * Incandescent Reflector Lamps
  * Metal Halide Lamp Fixtures

If you are a seller, use any of the image slots (other than **Energy Guide
Label** , **Lighting Facts Label** , **Main** , and **Swatch**) to upload the
energy icon as a product image.

## Water use information

Sellers and vendors are required to display water use information on detail
pages for the following products:

  * Showerheads
  * Faucets
  * Water Closets (flush toilets)
  * Urinals

The product's water use must be expressed in gallons and liters per minute
(gpm and L/min) or per cycle (gpc and L/cycle) for showerheads and faucets, or
gallons and liters per flush (gpf and Lpf) for water closets (flush toilets)
and urinals. However, these values are not required to be displayed in liters
if impractical due to the size of the fitting or fixture.

Display water use information on the detail page in the **Key Product
Features** section (also referred to as **Bullet Points**).
