Now that you have an idea of where you'd like to expand your business, it's
time to explore how taxes and regulations might affect your business for each
store in which you intend to sell. This section provides an overview by region
of the taxes and regulations you should be aware of when selling in Amazon's
various stores and enlisting third-party resources. We recommend that you
consult your tax and regulatory advisors before making decisions about how you
will sell in other stores. For support in finding a trusted tax advisor to

Every country has legal and industry requirements concerning sales of products
to consumers. In your home store, there are probably laws that pertain to
intellectual property rights, product safety, environmental, and other
applicable requirements. The same is true for all stores. Do your research and
understand your responsibilities. Some things to consider are:

  * Tax and customs
  * Intellectual property rights, in particular IP law restrictions on parallel import
  * Export controls
  * Markings and labels
  * Environmental, Health, and Safety
  * Product compliance \- check out Amazon's Compliance Reference tool to find requirements in your chosen store
