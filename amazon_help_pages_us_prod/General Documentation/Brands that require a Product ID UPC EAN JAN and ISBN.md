Our research shows that duplicate listings caused by missing or invalid
Product IDs make it more difficult for customers to find, evaluate, and
purchase products. To improve the customer experience, we require a valid
Product ID for new and existing listings of designated brands in all
categories (see [Brands that Require GTIN to list](https://s3-us-
west-2.amazonaws.com/gtin-exemption-templates/NA-
EN/Brands_Require_GTIN_US.xls)). New listings for these designated brands that
do not have a valid Product ID will be rejected in the listing creation
process and you will receive a listing error. Existing listings for these
designated brands that do not have a valid Product ID will be suppressed from
search and browse on Amazon until a valid Product ID is added.

Regardless of any GTIN exemptions you may have been granted in the past, if
you sell any items within these designated brands, your listing will be
suppressed from search and browse on Amazon if it does not have a valid
Product ID. See [Suppressed listings](/gp/help/G200898440) for more.

You can add a valid Product ID by editing the listing in the Manage Inventory
tab or by submitting a feed with valid UPCs for the listings.
