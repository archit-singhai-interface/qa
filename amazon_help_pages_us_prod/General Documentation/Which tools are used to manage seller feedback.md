[Feedback Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/seller-
rating/pages/feedback-manager.html?language=en_US&ref=ag_srfdback_cont_12051)
is a tool that helps you manage and monitor your seller feedback. This tool
provides a consolidated view of seller feedback and rating, and helps you
monitor your performance by displaying short-term and long-term feedback
rating metrics. It also helps you take guided actions concerning buyers’
issues and request for removal of negative feedback.

You can use Feedback Manager to address any situation by researching the cause
behind each negative rating and addressing the buyer’s concerns by making
improvements to your processes and policies. For tips on improving and
managing feedback, see [Best practices to maintain positive feedback and
rating](/gp/help/G12051).

The Feedback Manager consists of two tables:

  * Feedback Rating table: This table displays the percentages of positive, negative, and neutral feedback rating aggregated for the past 30, 90, 365 days. It also captures record for lifetime. 
  * Recent Feedback table: This table is ordered by the date when feedback was received, rating, Order ID, and Actions. Under Actions, you can opt to perform the following:
    * [Request removal of feedback](/gp/help/GSVLUKGSWX9EEM9N) (should be done only via [Feedback Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/feedback-manager/index.html#/))
    * [Post a public reply](/gp/help/GFX3VZKQVANVXRRB)

**Note:** You can download a report for all neutral and negative feedback by
viewing the instructions in [Download a report of buyer
feedback](/gp/help/G202125660).
