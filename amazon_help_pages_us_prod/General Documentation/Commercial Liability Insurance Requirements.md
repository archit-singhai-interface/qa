Commercial liability insurance will protect you from incidents resulting from
the products you sell, and give you peace of mind while you focus on growing
your business. Under section 9 of the [Amazon Services Business Solutions
Agreement](/gp/help/G1791), you must obtain and maintain commercial liability
insurance within 30 days after exceeding USD 10,000 in gross proceeds in sales
in one month on Amazon.com, or if otherwise requested by us.

You may purchase either commercial general, excess, or umbrella liability
insurance. When you decide on an insurance provider, your policy should cover
all products you list for sale in the Amazon.com store.

#### Insurance policy criteria

Your commercial liability insurance policy must meet all of the following
criteria, unless otherwise required by applicable law or regulation:  

  1. The insurance policy type can be either commercial general, umbrella, or excess liability;
  2. The policy must be written on an “occurrence basis”;  

    1. If you cannot procure an “occurrence-based policy” for certain product categories that are outlined in the [Frequently asked questions](/mario/v2/az/flow/BusinessInsurance/page/InsuranceEstablishment/global/render?view=up&), reach out to your insurer for a ‘claims-made policy’;
  3. The policy limit must be at least USD 1 million per occurrence and in aggregate, and cover liabilities caused by or occurring in conjunction with your business operations, including products, products/completed operations and bodily injury;
  4. The deductible for any policy(ies) must not be greater than $10,000. Any deductible amount must be listed on your Certificate of Insurance;
  5. The policy must cover all sales from products you have listed on the Amazon.com store;
  6. The policy must name "Amazon.com Services LLC and its affiliates and assignees" as additional insureds;
  7. The policy must not have any sunset clause;
  8. Except for single-member LLCs, your insured name must match the “legal entity” name you provided to Amazon in your [Account Info](/sw/AccountInfo/LegalEntity/step/LegalEntity). For single member LLCs, where your legal entity name is different than the name you publicly use to identify your business (“trade name,” “doing business as,” or “DBA”), it is also acceptable for your insured name to match your trade name;
  9. Your insurance provider must have global claim handling capability and a financial rating of [S&P](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/sector/insurance/insurance-sector) A- and/or [AM Best](https://www.ambest.com/home/default.aspx) A- or better (if S&P or AM best is not valid or used in the country where you are required to obtain insurance, a local equivalent is allowed);
  10. The policy must be completed in its entirety and signed by an authorized representative of your insurance provider; and 
  11. Your insurance provider must give Amazon at least 30 days’ notice of cancellation, modification, or non-renewal.

Amazon will consider exceptions to these requirements on a case-by-case basis
if you are unable to secure a policy that meets these requirements. For more
information about our requirements, go to Frequently Asked Questions section
