## Enrollment guidelines for Singapore

Trademark details help us identify your brand during the enrollment process.
Since each trademark office presents information in a different way, we’ve
compiled country and region-specific instructions so that you can easily find
the trademark details needed to complete the Brand Registry application.

To get started, go to [Intellectual Property Office of Singapore
(IPOS)](https://digitalhub.ipos.gov.sg/FAMN/eservice/IP4SG/MN_Index?OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=HXXQ-
BIX8-ZTXR-AKME-PP2P-6RG2-NYY4-NSR7) and search for your trademark by following
the steps below:  

  1. Enter your trademark number in the search field.
  2. Select **Trade mark application no.** from the drop-down menu and click **Search**.
  3. Find your trademark in the search results table and click the hyperlink of its application number.

## Brand name

Confirm the spelling and format of your trademark name next to **Trade mark
image**. Then, in the **What is your brand name?** field of the Brand Registry
application, enter the trademark name exactly as it appears on IPOS.

## Trademark office

In the **Select a trademark office** field of the Brand Registry application,
select **Singapore – Intellectual Property Office of Singapore – IPOS**.

## Trademark number

To find your trademark’s number on IPOS, review the information next to
**Trade mark no.**. Then, enter this number in the **Please enter the
registration number** field of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** We do not accept international application numbers or international
registration numbers in place of the trademark number.

**_WIPO portal_**

If your trademark was issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO), you can find the IPOS-issued trademark number by going to the [WIPO IP
portal](https://www3.wipo.int/branddb/en/) and following the steps below:  

  1. Under **Search by** , select **Numbers**.
  2. In the **Registration** field, enter the trademark’s WIPO number and click **Search**. 
  3. Find and click the trademark in the search results table. 
  4. Above **Full details** , the IPOS-issued trademark number will appear next to the trademark number (for example, 123456 – trademark name). 

## Trademark registration status

We accept trademarks from Singapore that are either registered or pending
registration.

To find the status of your trademark on IPOS, review the details next to
**Mark status**.

Then, locate this status in the table below to understand if your trademark is
considered “Registered” or “Pending” in Brand Registry. In the **What is the
current status of your trademark?** field of the Brand Registry application,
select the appropriate status.

**Status on IPOS** | **Status to select in application**  
---|---  
Registered | Registered  
Pending (formalities check) Pending (published) Pending (under examination) | Pending  
  
**Note:** All other trademark statuses are ineligible for Brand Registry at
this time.

## Trademark type

To determine your trademark’s type, review the image that appears next to
**Trade mark image**.

If the image displays a colored design or logo, or is composed of lower-case
and upper-case letters, then your trademark is an image-based mark (design
mark).

If an image does not appear, or if letters appear in the same case (all upper-
case or all lower-case) in black and white, then your trademark is a text-
based mark (word mark).

Then, select the trademark type under the **Select the trademark type**
section of the Brand Registry application.

**Note:** Only word mark and design mark trademarks are eligible for initial
enrollment in Brand Registry. Other trademark types can be added to your
account once you’ve enrolled in Brand Registry. To learn more, go to [Add
additional trademarks to your brand](/help/hub/reference/GQCYJTBSFZK8HGN6).
