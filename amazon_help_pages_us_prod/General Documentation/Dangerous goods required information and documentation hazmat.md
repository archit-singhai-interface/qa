Specific dangerous goods (also known as hazardous material) information must
be provided to Amazon when you list a new product on Fulfillment by Amazon
(FBA).

After your listing is created, we may require a safety data sheet (SDS) or
exemption sheet from you. Not providing required information and documentation
can result in delayed shipments and canceled customer deliveries. Products
with incomplete, inaccurate, or conflicting information may be blocked for
sale through FBA.

To upload an SDS or exemption sheet, go to [Manage dangerous goods
classification](/gp/fba/material-safety-data-sheet/index.html) and click
**Upload document**. For more information on dangerous goods, go to [Dangerous
goods identification guide (hazmat)](/gp/help/G201003400) or watch this Seller
University video: [Dangerous goods
overview](/learn/courses?moduleId=401&courseId=109).

**Important:** Even if your product is not regulated as a dangerous good, we
recommend that you provide any available dangerous goods information or
documentation when you create your offer. This will help reduce any delays in
processing.

## Information required for new listings

When creating or converting a listing for FBA, you must include dangerous
goods information for both **batteries** and **products regulated as dangerous
goods** by clicking **Add dangerous goods information** in the workflow. Make
sure to provide accurate and complete information so that your product is
properly classified and not blocked for sale.

**Required information for batteries**

Under **Battery information** , tell us whether your product is a battery or
uses batteries. If you answer **Yes** , more information will be required, as
outlined below:

**Are batteries included?** | Select ‘Yes’ if your product meets any of the following criteria:

  * Batteries are contained in or with the product (for example, Bluetooth headphones).
  * Batteries are included or packed separately with the equipment (for example, camera, remote control batteries, hand or yard tools).
  * The product itself is a battery.

  
---|---  
**Is battery a button cell or coin battery?** |  A button cell battery is a small single cell battery that has a diameter greater than its height. These batteries can also be referred to as a watch battery, cell or a coin battery cell. If your product contains or is a battery that meets the above definition then select ‘Yes’.  
**Does your product contain more than one battery operated product or item?** | Select ‘Yes’ if your product contains multiple battery-operated products. For example, a remote-controlled car where both the car and remote control contain, or are provided with a battery.  
**How are batteries utilized with this product?** | Select one of the following from the drop-down menu:

  * **Battery** if the product is a standalone battery, such as a replacement laptop battery, or if the battery is sold with items that it doesn’t power, such as a spare cell phone battery sold with a charger. External battery chargers, such as power banks, are considered batteries.
  * **Packed with** if the battery is packed with, but not inside of the device that it powers, such as a power tool with a removable battery packed alongside the tool.
  * **Contained in** if the battery is pre-installed or assembled in the item, such as a Kindle tablet or a mobile phone.
  * **Sold separately** if the battery is not included in the product’s package.

  
**Battery composition** | Select the battery composition from the drop-down menu (examples: alkaline, lithium-ion). This information is usually printed on the battery itself or on its packaging.  
  
If your battery product uses batteries, it may be a dangerous good that
requires some or all of the following information:

**Clarify whether the product is or contains a cell or battery.** | 

  * A cell is a single encased electrochemical unit (one positive and one negative electrode) which exhibits a voltage differential across its two terminals, and may contain protective devices.
  * A battery is two or more cells or batteries which are electronically connected together and fitted with devices necessary for use, for example, case, terminals, marking or protective devices. Units which have two or more cells that are commonly referred to as “battery packs”, “modules” or “battery assemblies” having the primary function of providing a source of power to another piece of equipment are treated as batteries.

  
---|---  
**Battery/Cell type/Size** | Select the type of battery from the drop-down menu (examples: AAA, CR123A). This information is usually printed on the battery itself or on its packaging. If you don’t know the battery type, select **Other**. If batteries are included with the product, be sure to include for any spare batteries provided.

**Required information for dangerous goods regulations**

Under **Product regulation information** , tell us whether your product is
considered a dangerous good or hazardous material regulated for
transportation, storage, waste, or all three ([Examples of possible dangerous
goods](/gp/help/G200525640)). If your product is not considered a dangerous
good or hazmat, answer **No**.

If you answer **Yes** , select whatever applies from the **Indicate type**
drop-down menu. Based on what you select, more information will be required
below. This also applies if you answer **Not sure**. This information can
include all or some of the following:

**UN number** | This information can be found on the safety data sheet (SDS) or obtained from the manufacturer. Include “UN” before the number (for example, UN1266), without any spaces in between.  
---|---  
**Product weight (kg)** | Enter the weight in kg (1 lb = 0.45 kg).  
**Product volume (milliliters)** | Enter volume in milliliters for a gas or liquid (1 fl oz = 29.6 ml).  
**Categorization/GHS pictograms** | If your product is considered a dangerous good or hazmat by GHS/CLP standards, select each pictogram that appears on your product’s packaging or SDS. (GHS stands for Globally Harmonized System of Classification, while CLP is Classification, Labeling, and Packaging.)  
  
For examples of GHS/CLP pictograms, go to [Dangerous goods identification
guide (hazmat)](/gp/help/201003400). To learn more about GHS/CLP, go to the
[UNECE](https://unece.org/about-ghs) website.

If available, also provide the following information:

  * **Safety data sheet URL:** The SDS of your product can be obtained from the manufacturer. More information about SDS is provided in the section below.
  * **Flash point:** The flash point of a product determines its flammability. Indicate the flash point of your product in Celsius (ºC). This information can be found on the SDS or can be procured from the manufacturer.

Once your product listing is created or converted to FBA, the review process
takes two business days (Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays).
For more information, go to [Dangerous goods review process
(hazmat)](/gp/help/201749580).

Use the **Look up an ASIN** tool to check the classification status of your
FBA ASIN.

**Important:** If the information requested above is missing, a product
listing cannot be created or converted to FBA. Also, if the provided
information is incomplete, inaccurate, or conflicting, your product may be
blocked for sale and more information will be required (see section below).

## Information required for existing listings

The Dangerous Goods team reviews each ASIN converted to FBA if the product is
identified as a possible dangerous good.

Products with complete and correct dangerous goods information will be
reviewed and classified within two business days (Monday through Friday,
excluding public holidays). Products with incomplete, inaccurate, or
conflicting information may be blocked for sale through FBA.

To ensure that your product is classified correctly, one or both of the
following documents might also be required:

  * **A safety data sheet:** If you haven't uploaded an SDS, the one that you uploaded is not valid, or the information in it is contradictory, obtain a complete and correct SDS from the manufacturer and upload it. If your product does not contain any harmful chemicals (for example, alcohol, acid, and sodium) and you can’t obtain an SDS, upload an exemption sheet.
  * **Exemption sheet:** If you haven't provided complete and accurate information, upload an exemption sheet for either batteries and battery-powered products or for products without harmful chemicals.

Amazon regularly reviews products in our fulfillment centers that may be
regulated as dangerous goods to ensure that shipments comply with regulations
and safety standards. If your product is found to be missing complete
dangerous goods information, we’ll ask you to submit either an SDS or
exemption sheet.

**Important:** If your product is identified as a possible dangerous good
while inventory is already in an Amazon fulfillment center, we will notify you
by email. You'll have 14 business days to provide the requested documentation.
If the documentation is not provided during this period, the inventory will be
disposed of, at your expense.

For more information, go to [Dangerous goods review process
(hazmat)](/gp/help/201749580).

**Safety data sheets**

A safety data sheet (or SDS, previously known as a material safety data sheet)
contains 16 sections prepared by the manufacturer or importer. An SDS
describes a product’s physical and chemical properties, physical and health
hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency
and first-aid procedures, and control measures.

An SDS enables Amazon to:

  * Correctly classify your products as either dangerous goods or non-dangerous goods so that they can be properly stored and transported.
    * Determine the correct handling and disposal measures if a product spills or leaks in a fulfillment center 
  * Confirm your products as non-regulated goods 

To be compliant, an SDS must:

  * Be created or updated within the past five years
  * Include new GHS/CLP hazard identification information 
  * Match your product listing
    * The product name shown on the SDS is the same as the listing title (the product name, as it appears on the detail page)
    * Manufacturer or brand name of your product on the SDS is the same as what appears on the detail page
  * Include all 16 standard SDS sections

For more information, watch the Seller University video on [Submitting Safety
Data Sheets](/learn/courses?moduleId=538).

**Upload safety data sheets**

To upload an SDS, go to [Manage dangerous goods
classification](/gp/fba/material-safety-data-sheet/index.html) and click
**Upload document**. The Dangerous Goods team will review your SDS within two
business days (Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays).

To avoid classification delays, make sure that your SDS complies with the
requirements listed above. Use the **Look up an ASIN** tool above to check the
status of your product.

**Important:** If your listing is a bundle or a kit with multiple chemical-
based products, then you must provide an SDS for each product within the
bundle or kit.

**Exemption sheets**

For products that don’t require an SDS, an exemption sheet is acceptable for
these two categories **only** :

  * Battery and battery-powered products
  * Products without harmful chemicals 

**Important:** If you submit an exemption sheet for products not in these two
categories, then it will be rejected. Be sure to fill in your exemption sheet
completely and correctly to ensure that it’s accepted. The Dangerous Goods
team will review your exemption sheet within two business days (Monday through
Friday, excluding public holidays).

**Upload exemption sheets**

First, find information for your product’s category:

  * **Battery and battery-powered products:** Check the product packaging, the product manual, or the battery itself to find specific battery information such as watt-hours and voltage. For more information on lithium batteries, go to [Requirements for lithium batteries and products that contain lithium batteries](/gp/help/200383420).
  * **Products without harmful chemicals:** Check the product packaging or the product itself to find specific information such as ingredients, pictograms, or warning phrases.
