When you delete a listing, the Contribution SKU and all sales history and
product information are permanently removed from your seller account.
Therefore, you must delete a Contribution SKU and its listing information only
if you are never planning to sell that product in the future.

**Note:** In order to remove your offer from the detail page, update the
inventory quantity to 0 and then delete the Contribution SKU. If the inventory
is not updated to 0, the offer will still remain live on the All-Offers
Display page since Contribution SKU deletion and inventory quantity deletion
are separate operations.

  1. On the **Inventory** menu, select **Manage All Inventory**.

  2. Find the listing you want to delete:
     * For a single listing, select **Delete product and listing** from the drop-down menu in the same row.
     * For multiple listings, select the box to the left of the listings you want to delete. From the **Action on selected** drop-down menu above the list, select **Delete products and listings**.

  3. Click **OK** to delete, or click **Cancel** to keep the listing.
