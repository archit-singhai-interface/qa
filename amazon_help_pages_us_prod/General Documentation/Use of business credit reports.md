You authorize us and any of our Affiliates to obtain business credit reports
and other related information about your business at any time from one or more
business credit reporting agencies and other third parties at no cost to your
business. We will use such reports and information for lawful purposes,
including the following:

  * To verify your businessâ€™ identity
  * To detect and prevent fraud
  * To evaluate your business for, and to recommend, financing products and services
  * To underwrite, process, and manage financing products and services offered to your business
  * To develop and improve Amazon financing products, services, processes, and models

You authorize us and any of our Affiliates to contact third parties to verify
information you submit to receive a financing product or service. Your consent
applies until you terminate your account, and terminating your account will
not affect any other consent you may have provided in a separate agreement
even if of a similar nature, including Amazon Lending financing terms that you
may separately agree to if you apply for or accept the services of an Amazon
Lending financing product.
