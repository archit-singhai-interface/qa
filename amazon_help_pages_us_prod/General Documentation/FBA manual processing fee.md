If you choose not to provide box content information, Amazon will manually
process your boxes at the fulfillment center and a fee will apply. Shipments
that are manually processed may be received more slowly than shipments with
box content information.  
  
**Note:** Each box that you include in the shipment must have its own unique
FBA box ID label printed from your Shipping Queue, even if you are not
providing box content information. Failure to label your boxes with the
required FBA box ID label may lead to the blocking of future shipments.

## Fee rates

Months | Manual processing fee  
---|---  
January - October | $0.15 per unit  
November - December | $0.30 per unit  
  
The applicable FBA manual processing fee is based on the time the first unit
of a shipment is received at the fulfillment center. For example, if the first
unit of a shipment is received at the fulfillment center in October, then the
$0.15 per unit fee will apply to all units in that shipment (even if some are
received in November). Likewise, if the first unit of a shipment is received
at the fulfillment center in December, then the $0.30 per unit fee will apply
to all units in that shipment, even if some are received in January.

**Important:** Note that the fee preview rate may differ from the applicable
rate. For example, if a shipment is sent in October, when the fee preview
indicates a rate of $0.15 per unit, but the first unit of the shipment is not
received at the fulfillment center until November, the $0.30 per unit rate
(the applicable rate at the time the first unit is received) will apply to all
units in the shipment.

The fee will be charged 14 days after the first unit of your shipment is
received at the fulfillment center. You will be charged for the number of
units received as of the date when the fee is charged. If your shipment
contains units that are received after the FBA manual processing fee has
already been charged on the shipment, you will be charged for these additional
units at the next 14-day interval.

## Choosing to apply the fee

When creating a shipment to Amazon, if you select the **Skip box information
and apply manual processing fee** option in the **Prepare Shipment** step of
the shipment creation workflow, the fee will be applied to your shipment. You
will be shown a preview of the estimated fee amount, and the fee will be
charged after your shipment has been received at the fulfillment center.

**Important:** Choosing the FBA manual processing fee option may cause delays
in receiving your shipment. Shipments that are manually processed require more
processing time than shipments with box content information.
