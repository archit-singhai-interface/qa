**Important:** Failure to comply with FBA product preparation requirements,
safety requirements, and product restrictions may result in the refusal of
inventory at the Amazon fulfillment center, disposal or return of inventory,
blocking of future shipments to the fulfillment center, or charging for
preparation or for noncompliance at the fulfillment center.

Any jewelry unit that can be damaged by tearing, dirt, dust or liquid during
the fulfillment process must be packaged following these guidelines. Jewelry
must be packaged so that the unit cannot be damaged or cause unsafe conditions
by having the material exposed during the fulfillment process.

Watch these brief videos for examples of how to prep your products for
shipment to and storage in Amazon fulfillment centers.

  * Bagging
  * Taping
  * Labeling

## Pouches

  * Pouches must be packed individually in plastic bags with the barcode on the outside of the pouch to avoid damage from dust. Place a product description label on the side with the greatest surface area.
  * The bag should be appropriate for size of a pouch. Do not force a pouch into a bag that is too small or place it in a bag where it can easily shift around. The edges of large bags are more likely to get caught and tear exposing contents to dust or dirt.
  * Poly bags (minimum 1.5 mil.) with a 5" opening or larger must have a "suffocation warning." Example: "Plastic bags can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation; keep this bag away from babies and children."
  * All poly bags must be transparent.

Examples of pouches properly packaged one per bag with barcode inside the bag
for protection against dust. The bags are slightly larger than the
pouches.![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/fc-

Example of pouch that is exposed, unprotected, and improperly packaged. The
contents of the pouch are bagged, but the barcode is inside the pouch and
cannot be scanned without removing it from the pouch.![](https://images-

## Boxed Jewelry

  * Boxes made of material that is easily cleaned do not have to be bagged. Sleeves are sufficient protection from dust.
  * Boxes made of fabric-like material that is susceptible to dust or tearing must to be bagged or boxed individually with barcode displayed prominently.
  * Protective sleeve or bag should be only slightly larger than unit.
  * Box sleeves should be snug enough or secured in such a way that they will not slide off and the barcode must be visible with the sleeve in place.
  * Barcodes should be attached to box if possible; they can be attached to sleeves if secured properly.

This example shows a fabric-like box properly stored in a bag slightly larger
than the box. This is properly packaged.![](https://images-na.ssl-images-

This example shows a box stored in a bag that is much larger than the unit and
the label is not on the box. This bag is more likely to be punctured or torn
and the barcode separated from the unit. This is improperly
packaged.![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/fc-
images/Box2.png)

This example shows a box poorly protected by a sleeve that is not secured
enabling the box to slip out and become separated from the sleeve and the
barcode. This is improperly packaged.![](https://images-na.ssl-images-

## Best practice for high-value jewelry

As high-value jewelry may not sell quickly, we recommend that you package
these Units in protective bags to help protect them while they are at the
fulfillment center. If you are sending products to FBA that have a Replacement
Value greater than $2,000.00, please be aware of the [FBA Lost and Damaged
reimbursement policy](/gp/help/200213130).

## Permitted packaging materials:

  * Poly Bags
  * Boxes
  * Labels
