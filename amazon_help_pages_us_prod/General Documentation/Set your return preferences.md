As an Amazon seller, you must comply with Amazon's return policies.

The return settings page allows you to customize your return options by store,
helping to ensure a smooth return process for both you and your customers.

To adjust your return settings, follow these steps:  

  1. Go to [Return settings](/gp/returns/settings/). 
  2. In the **Marketplace** column, locate the store that you want to edit. 
  3. Select options from drop-down menus.
  4. Click **Save settings** to apply your changes.

## Key settings

**Return authorization**

Set your default return request authorization rules using one of the following
options:

  * **In policy (Amazon):** We will automatically authorize US return requests that fall within [our returns policies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=15015721&language=en_US&ref=ag_home_cont_201747150).
  * **Manual (seller):** You will authorize all return requests manually.

**Note:** For the US store, we automatically authorize US return requests that
fall within our returns policies, including items for which you’ve filed a
request to exempt a SKU from the prepaid return label program. Out-of-policy
or category-exempt returns will be sent for manual authorization.

**Amazon prepaid return labels**

In stores where Amazon prepaid return labels are required, such as the US, we
automatically enroll you in the [prepaid return label
program](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G202072200). You’ll see the
following options:

  * **Enrolled** : You’re part of the program (required for US store).
  * **Enroll** : Click to opt in to prepaid return labels (if available for the store). In stores where the program isn’t available yet, the **Enroll** button will be grayed out.

**Label type**

If you’re enrolled in the prepaid return label program, your label type will
be set to **Amazon prepaid**. If you’re not enrolled, you’ll have the
following options:

  * **Seller prepaid** : You will provide a seller-prepaid return label.
  * **Unpaid label** : We will provide an unpaid mailing label.

**Return merchandise authorization**

For this column, you’ll have the following options:

  * **Amazon** : We will generate a return merchandise authorization number.
  * **Seller** : You will provide a return merchandise authorization number.

**Labels for exempt items**

For returns of seller-fulfilled items that are exempt from the prepaid return
label program, you’ll have the option to upload a seller-paid label or have us
issue an unpaid label on your behalf.

  * **Seller prepaid** : You will provide buyers with a seller-prepaid return label.
  * **Unpaid label** : We will provide an unpaid mailing label.

**Return instructions**

To learn how to provide return instructions for each of the stores in which
you sell, go to [Set your return instructions](/gp/help/G201711800).

## Manage return templates

Return templates allow you to set program overrides and exemptions for
specific SKUs across your registered stores. Managing these templates
effectively can help streamline your return processes and ensure consistent
policies across your inventory.

To access the templates, follow these steps:

  * Go to [Return settings](/gp/returns/settings/). 
  * At the top right, click **Manage return templates**.

From this page, you can download existing templates or upload new ones for all
your registered stores.

**Return template file**

The input file for return templates consists of SKUs and their associated
actions. Follow these guidelines when preparing your file.

  * File structure:
    * Two header rows
    * Multiple data rows containing SKUs and actions intended for them
  * SKU field requirements:
    * Maximum length: 40 characters 
    * No special control characters, such as newlines
  * File limitations:
    * Maximum of 50,000 SKUs per file
