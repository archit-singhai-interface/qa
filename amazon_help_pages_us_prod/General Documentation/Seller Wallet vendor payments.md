The payments feature for Amazon Seller Wallet lets you pay vendors directly
from Seller Central. The feature is available if you use Seller Wallet.

If you don’t have a Seller Wallet account, go to [Seller
Wallet](/gp/help/GW57DZACAZGNREVQ) for more details on how to enroll.

To access the payments feature, select **Seller Wallet** from the **Reports**
drop-down menu in Seller Central. Then, select **Payments** from the left-hand
menu.

## Send a payment

You can send payments for business or commercial purposes. Before you can send
a payment, you must add your vendor and their bank details to your Seller
Wallet account.

You’re able to send payments in US dollars only to vendors with a US or Hong
Kong-based bank account. We do not support non-US dollar currencies for
payments to vendors.

To send a payment to a vendor, go to your Seller Wallet account. Select
**Payments** from the left-hand menu and fill out the payment form.

Before you add a vendor to your account, you must get their payment details,
including their bank information. You’ll be required to confirm this
information when you add the vendor to your account and before you send a
payment.

Once you’ve confirmed a vendor payment, the payment cannot be canceled and
isn’t refundable. You can contact your vendor to request a refund from them
directly.

There’s a maximum transaction limit of $25,000 for vendor payments. If you are
sending a payment to a vendor’s Hong Kong bank account, there’s a minimum
transaction size of $2,500.

## Add, update, or delete vendor information

You can add up to 25 vendors to your Seller Wallet account. To pay a new
vendor, you must delete one of the 25 vendors to be able to add a new one.

To add a new vendor, follow these steps:

  1. Go to your Seller Wallet account. 

  2. Select **Payments** from the left-hand menu.

  3. Click the **Add a new recipient** link from the **Payment** tab or from the **Manage Recipients** tab.

  4. Fill out the recipient form, including the vendor’s name, address, and bank details.

We require vendors to undergo a review process. The review process typically
takes three business days the first time that you add a vendor, but some
reviews may take longer.

We’ll notify you via email if we require more information or clarification to
complete the review process. If your vendor has not been reviewed in three
days, please check your emails to ensure that we haven’t contacted you for
more information.

To update your vendor’s information, such as the name or bank account, you can
simply delete your vendor with the outdated information, and add a new vendor
with the correct details.

To delete a vendor from your Seller Wallet account, follow these steps:

  1. Go to your Seller Wallet account.

  2. Click **Payments**.

  3. Click the **Manage Recipients** tab.

  4. On the Manage Recipients page, locate your vendor and click **Delete**.

You can also check the status of your recipient on the Manage Recipients page.

## Fees

It’s free to send payments in US dollars to vendors with a US bank account.

There’s a fee to send payments to a US dollar-denominated bank account in Hong
Kong. This fee decreases as your business with Amazon grows, as shown in the
following table:

Cross-currency net proceeds (US dollars)* | Payments to US bank accounts | Payments to Hong Kong-US dollar bank accounts  
---|---|---  
$10 million+ | Free | 0.40%  
$1 million–$10 million | Free | 0.50%  
$500,000–$1 million | Free | 0.60%  
Less than $500,000 | Free | 0.70%  
  
* The payment fees are based on your total cross-currency net proceeds during the past 12 months across all Amazon stores. Cross-border proceeds are proceeds from an Amazon store in which the currency is different from your local currency. The international transaction fee varies for some currencies. To view pricing for all currencies, go to [Seller Wallet transfer and fees](/gp/help/GE8JLFJQBVYFZT6S). 

## Payment status

To check the status of a payment, follow these steps:

  1. Go to your Seller Wallet account.

  2. Click **Payments**.

  3. Click the **Payment History** tab.

  4. On the Payment History page, locate your payment and view the corresponding status.

If you believe that there have been unauthorized payments or other activity
associated with your Seller Wallet account, please contact [Selling Partner
Support](/help/center) immediately.
