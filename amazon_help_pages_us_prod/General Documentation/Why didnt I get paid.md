Your payment might be on the way! It can take up to five business days for
money to appear in your bank account after Amazon initiates a deposit. You can
check the payment date of any settlement period in your [Payments
Dashboard](/gp/payments-account/settlement-summary.html/).

Use the tool below to find out why you might not have received a payment.

For questions related to your ten most recent payments:  

  1. Click the **Statement view** tab and select the settlement cycle from the **Settlement period** drop-down list.
  2. If the settlement period for the payment in question is still open, which is represented by **Present (open)** , wait until the completion of the cycle for it to be closed. You can see the date when your next payment is due at the bottom of the page.
  3. If the payment you are looking for belongs to one of the older settlement periods, refer to the **All statements** or **Disbursements** tab. Here, you can search within a customized date range or navigate through your statements manually by scrolling and using the pagination buttons.
  4. If a successful payment, whose **Disbursement status** is **Done** , is not reflected in your bank account, contact your bank using the Trace ID. You can find the Trace IDs of payments in the **Disbursements** tab.

Keeping your seller account up to date and in good standing are the best ways
to ensure that you receive payments promptly. Here are common reasons for
payment delays:

  * [Bank account](/sw/AccountInfo/DepositMethodView/step/DepositMethodView?ref_=macs_aidepvw_cont_acinfohm&) or [credit card information](/sw/AccountInfo/ChargeMethod/step/View?ref_=macs_aichrgvw_cont_acinfohm) is missing or invalid. Both are required for Amazon to initiate a payment, so ensure both are up to date in your account settings.

**Note:** Whenever you add or update your bank account information, a
mandatory three-day security hold takes effect before we can initiate a funds
transfer. For this reason, we recommend not to update your bank account
information within three days of any payment date.

  * The account has a [negative or zero balance](/gp/help/G16261) at the time of payment. This could happen because of selling fees or product refunds. We might charge your credit card to cover the selling fees in this situation.
  * All or some of your funds might be withheld as per the [Funds withholding policy](/gp/help/G9RA9LYBJ3QP27M6).
  * Shipment for an order is not confirmed. For more information, go to [How to confirm a shipment](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200197960).
  * For Express Payout disbursements and common reasons why the disbursement is not in your account yet, go to [Express Payout frequently asked questions](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GA24UN79VBPKXZXX).

Less common reasons for payment delays can include actions that we take in
response to performance issues or suspicious activity related to your seller
account. In this case, you find messages from Amazon with additional details
in [Performance notifications](/gp/customer-experience/perf-
notifications.html).
