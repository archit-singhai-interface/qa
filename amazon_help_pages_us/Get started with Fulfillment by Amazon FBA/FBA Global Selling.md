Fulfillment by Amazon enables you to expand your business globally.

There are two methods of selling globally:

  * **FBA Export** enables you to list your FBA products on Amazon or your own website. Then Amazon exports your orders to customers around the world.
  * **Amazon Global Selling** enables you to list and sell your products on several of our websites around the world. Ship your inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers in the countries you listed in, and we deliver to the customer for you.
