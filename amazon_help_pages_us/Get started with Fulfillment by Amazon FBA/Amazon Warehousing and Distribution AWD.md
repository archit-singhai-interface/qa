Amazon Warehousing and Distribution is a third-party logistics program that
provides long-term, upstream bulk inventory storage that’s cost effective. In
addition, the program automatically replenishes your inventory in Prime-ready
fulfillment centers.

There are no fees for enrolling in the program. You’ll be charged only when
you send your inventory to Warehousing and Distribution facilities.
