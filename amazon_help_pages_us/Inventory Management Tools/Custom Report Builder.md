The Custom Report Builder is a reporting wizard in Seller Central that enables
you to create and save customized reporting views by dragging and dropping
data fields from a given list of attributes.

The tool allows you to easily visualize various aspects of your business by
building your own custom reports from a pre-populated **Business view**.
Business views bring together data fields from various reports that are
relevant to a particular aspect of your business, such as **Inventory**.

For example, the **Inventory** business view aggregates all key information
for a given FNSKU and fulfillment center combination and a given date range.
This key information includes such data as inventory that is in transit, in a
fulfillment center, being delivered to buyers, lost, or damaged.

You can build custom reports in a few simple steps, which are described in
more detail below:

  1. Select a domain, or **Business view**.

  2. Drag and drop the desired attributes. 

  3. Select a date range. 

  4. Generate your custom report.

With the Custom Report Builder, you can do the following:

  * Generate a report
  * Download the report
  * Create and save a custom view
  * Edit or delete the custom view
  * Mark a view as a **Favorite** for easy access

Creating customized reporting views and saving them for future use lets you
avoid having to download a full report with all the columns. Creating a
customized reporting view is helpful when you’re looking for specific data
fields and aren’t sure which report to use or where to find it.

For example, if you want to see data about damaged inventory units, but you’re
not sure which report to use, you can go to the [Custom Report
Builder](/reportcentral/CUSTOM_REPORT_BUILDER/new) and select the
**Inventory** business view, which will populate all the relevant attributes.
Then you can add the **Damaged** attribute to your customized reporting view,
and generate a report for your desired date range.

The Custom Report Builder aims to end the frustration that can arise from the
following:

  * The difficulty in finding the right report
  * The need to jump through several tabs and reports to find the right information
  * The inability to reconcile related reports due to varying granularity of the underlying data 

## How to use the Custom Report Builder

To access the Custom Report Builder, select **Fulfillment** from the
**Reports** drop-down menu in Seller Central. Within the tool, click **Take a
tour** to learn more.

To create a customized reporting view, follow these steps:

  1. Under the **Create new view** tab, select a **Business view** , or domain, for which you want to create the custom report, such as **Inventory**

  2. Select your desired attributes from the **Available attributes** list, and click **Add**. The list includes attributes such as **ASIN** , **MSKU** , **Product title** , **Disposition** , **Customer shipments** , and **Customer returns**. If you change your mind and want to remove an attribute, click **Remove**.

**Note:** Some attributes are mandatory in order to generate your report.
These attributes will appear automatically in the **Selected attributes**
field, and cannot be removed.

**Tip:** To see a definition for an attribute, hover your cursor on “i” button
next to it.

  3. Select a date range from the **Select date range** drop-down menu, or enter a custom date range. 

  4. Click **Generate report**. Your custom report will include only the attributes that you have chosen.

## Save your selections

To save your customized selections for the report, click **Save view**. You
can access your saved views for future use by clicking the **Your saved
views** tab.

Saved views appear in the order in which they were last used. You can mark
your views as **Favorite** using the toggle button to the right of each view
name.

**Note:** Initially, we’re launching this tool with the **Inventory** business
view and select data fields. In future phases, we’ll add more attributes from
various reports, as well as other business views such **Returns** or
**Shipments**.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Where can I see my previously downloaded custom reports

You can see the list of previous downloads on either the **Create new view**
or **Your saved views** tab. Once you select a date range and click **Generate
report** , the request will be shown in the activity table along with its
current status, such as **In progress** or **Ready for download**.

Once the report has been generated, you can download it, and any previously
generated reports, by clicking the corresponding **Download** button.

#### Why can’t I remove a pre-selected attribute?

The Custom Report Builder shows certain attributes as pre-selected in the
**Selected attributes** field. Currently, these attributes are mandatory for
creating any custom view within that business domain. These mandatory
attributes define the lowest level of detail that is supported by the business
view and therefore can’t be removed.

#### How can I reconcile Custom Report Builder data with other reports on
Seller Central?

The Custom Report Builder combines data from multiple reports, and its data
may be at a different level of detail than existing reports. As a result,
reconciliation might not always be possible. However, the data between reports
and the Custom Report Builder should match as long as the same level of detail
and the same date ranges are being compared.

#### I can’t select the date range that I want.

Currently, the Custom Report Builder supports a 30-day time period. To view
data for a broader date range, use the existing reports in Seller Central.

#### The data in the Custom Report Builder doesn’t match with the
corresponding report. For example, the tool’s Inventory view doesn’t match
with the Inventory Ledger report.

Initially, we are launching the Custom Report Builder with the **Inventory**
business view only. The **Inventory** view should match exactly with the
Inventory Ledger report for a given combination of date, FNSKU, and
fulfillment center ID. If the data doesn’t match, make sure that the
attributes that you selected are consistent between the two reports.

#### I can’t find the attributes I need. How can I get them added?

If you don’t see a desired attribute in the **Business view** list, please
leave a comment using the **Feedback** option on bottom-left corner of the
page, or through the **Rate this page** option in the Custom Report Builder,
and we will try to include these attributes in our future updates.
